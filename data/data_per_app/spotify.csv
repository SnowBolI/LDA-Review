Spotify is getting aggresive with ads. After every 2 or 3 songs there is ad. And ads for no reason are much louder than song. I guess developers as usually are playing mind games with users.,1,2025-06-18 22:18:20

"I've been using spotify since 2014. The way technology has evolved since yet this app, not so much. This is a multi-million dollar software yet not so impressive. By now, I should be able to search for liked songs based on a year and songs added to my library based on a year. The search overall hasn't changed at all, in fact. With such an enormous database of songs,I should be able to search by parts of lyrics or one word of the title. It might be time to develop my own ggroundbreakingapp 😉",4,2025-06-18 22:13:12

"Playlists are completely screwed, songs take forever to play, shuffling doesnt actually shuffle again when you click on a different song, you have to click on a whole different album or playlist for it to randomize again. The audacity of Spotify to charge for ad free listening, but clearly isnt using that money or any of the advertising money to improve user experience. Its absolutely ridiculous that they also want to raise that price, insane of them.",1,2025-06-18 22:09:09

"You can only skip up to 6 songs. Way too many ads! Your mood and your choice are useless here. Also, you need to link your TV app from your mobile and then each time the TV app opens, the mobile app also opens and drains your battery :( (P.S. this is for mobile app as a non-paying user; the website and the TV apps are much better experience)",1,2025-06-18 22:02:57

I did the update but your app is worthless!😡😠😤 if I'm playing from my Liked Songs category(pop) why are all the following songs from a different categoryI was listening to yesterday!! (r&b). if I go back one song it goes to my pop category if I go forward one song it goes into the R&B category. then it just randomly plays whatever songs it feels like playing for a related category. Hate Using this App 😠😤😡 don't tell me to do a quick uninstall and reinstall. I think the problem is your end.,1,2025-06-18 21:44:25

do not recomend you can get 6 skips if you make a playlist it adds songs you never even added annoying with the adds,1,2025-06-18 20:59:09
"THE WORST APP EVER.Spotify forces you to take the premium subscription by constantly giving ads, shuffle mode and unable to play the song I like and many more.It used to be good back then but now it is just useless piece of app.It is just good for nothing.I would rate It xeo stars if possible.",1,2025-06-18 20:59:02
"Unlike YouTube, you can play it when you go into another app or have the screen off, you can still play the music, downside is there'll be one 30 seconds ad audio every two songs and which is quite annoying.",3,2025-06-18 20:55:55
"the app is down too often, and ads appear way too often, back then without premium it was only 1 ad per 30 minutes, now after 4 to 5 songs I get an ad, I really do nut appreciate this treatment for someone that listens without premium, do you guys really not ashamed of your software?",2,2025-06-18 20:53:21

"Spotify is my one-stop music platform. I love that it has both functions, streaming, and mp3. The exact reason I do not use Pandora is because it completely lacks mp3 functionality. Spotify gives almost 100% of listener control. The only thing that could be added to make it better is a ""repeat A-B"" function, where you're able to control a specific spot in a song that you want to repeat. It is a function that has been lost due to time and technological advancement, and I dearly miss it.",5,2025-06-18 15:43:30

When I look up how to turn it off, it always tells me that I have to have a premium account to mess with the smart shuffle settings, but that's the funny thing I don't have a premium account, so why am I being affected it? it Doesn't shuffle the playlist, it only brings in one or 2 songs that I don't know.",1,2025-06-18 11:49:30
I hate ads,1,2025-06-18 11:49:07

"This app is for people who wants to listen to music for a comparatively low money. In many ways, Spotify is no better than Napster. But I'd you come to enjoying music without much budget for Napster, you can always count on Spotify. And moreover, if you have 2 accounts on Spotify, you can have 2 months for 60/month (120 for 2 or 3 months) offers every 4 months. I have two accounts, and I recharge using Google play, which I get to use Spotify 2 months for 120, then the same after 2 months.",5,2025-06-18 11:24:27
good music app just a lot of ads,4,2025-06-18 11:21:48
Love it and I use it every day. There also some cool features that I didn't get from the other music apps. would definitely recommend it!,5,2025-06-18 11:20:58
"I have nothing bad to say about Spotify except I wish offline play wasn't a premium expenditure, and instead was complimentary. As I don't have data about 95% of the year so I can't listen to anything and obviously if I can't afford data then premium is out of the picture. But that's more of a personal issue otherwise the app is really, really good.",5,2025-06-18 11:15:43
spotify is a great music and podcast app the audio is amazing and I can lison to this has every song you need I would put 10 stars if I could,5,2025-06-18 11:14:49
"As if not having premium is bad enough, I just reinstalled the app since it won't allow me to play songs. Yet after reinstalling it, it still won't allow me to play the song, it just gives me a preview?? Just make installing the app payed at this point. Premium is not even in my budget.",1,2025-06-18 11:12:40

Price is going up... AGAIN!!!... and you know what? still no comments to know if there will be change for the artists! We pay more and YET the artists earn nothing from it!

"I'm seriously so fed up with Spotify nowadays. 1. The app literally crashes almost every time I try to open it, and when it does open, it seems to be literally on the brink of crashing before it decides to work properly. 2. There are literally ads IN THE MIDDLE OF SONGS. I would be in the literal halfway mark of a song and enjoying it, when an ad starts playing, interrupting the song, then I have to wait for the ad to finish if I want to finish listening to the song. Pandora is more reliable.",1,2025-06-18 09:24:22

If you don't pay for premium the app is less than useless! I recently downgraded because the price goes up every few months and has doubled in the 4 years we've been using it. Seems like they make the free one punitive so you feel like you have no choice but to pay,1,2025-06-18 08:20:43

"Spotify has all the best music and podcasts and even some audio books, but the app is terrible. You can download content with premium, but it's like the app doesn't work without service. If I'm already listening to something I have downloaded, and then drive somewhere without service, there is no problem. But, If you don't have service and open the app, it will just inform you that you are offline and you can not even get to the downloads page",2,2025-06-18 07:35:10

"I still like Spotify, but the Free version is really concerning now. I am getting more ads than ever before. Many mixes are now shuffle locked where before it used to be all on-demand. I hate how greedy they have become because if you want premium, you have to pay £13.99/month which is ridiculous! You are going to lose users because of this, and I am planning to move to Tidal some point.",3,2025-06-18 03:16:48

Leeching money for basic purpose to play songs.. Or repeat songs.. Or play in order . Can you imagine I can't .play my own playlist. Where other songs can pop in.. Is it truly a good app or corporate scums leexhing money for no purpose at all. If they gave artists better pay. Then also I would have considered.,1,2025-06-17 22:36:36
"The Spotify app is one of the best uses of phone storage. I love the fact I can listen to any music I'd like on command, with ease of click of a button. Not only that aspect, but the suggestions for music similar to my taste allow me to easily explore new areas that I wouldn't previously had looked into.

There are many interruptions while listening to music , too many unwanted ads about them wanting me to buy Spotify premium and what not .

"One of the Best Music Apps Out There.The personalized playlists like Discover Weekly and Release Radar always introduce me to great new songs. Love how I can seamlessly switch between my phone, laptop, and smart speaker using Spotify Connect. The interface is clean, smooth,and super easy to use. Premium is totally worth it for the ad-free and music quality experience with 320kbps and offline listening. Can’t imagine a day without it.",5,2025-06-17 22:13:44
"It's honestly frustrating how Spotify still can’t understand my music taste, even with all the AI tech today. I like songs, skip ones I don’t, and create playlists — yet the recommendations feel random. I keep getting songs I’d never listen to. It makes the app feel disconnected, and it ruins the experience. Music is personal, and when Spotify fails to reflect that, it feels like I’m being ignored. Please fix your recommendation system.",1,2025-06-17 22:12:23
"I've always used YouTube and have recently started using this app. 4 months now. I have only used the free version thus far. The adds are much shorter and less frequent than YouTube. I often find the app glitches at random times for no apparent reason. Many of the songs I choose and try are a completely different song. I can not go back on track selection, only forward.

if you leave cell service there is a 50/50 chance that Spotify will stop working. you can try to restart/reset it but it will only open to a black screen. this is very annoying since I have a whole playlist downloaded for when I'm out of service and can't get any of it to play. other than that they tend to play the same songs over and over again even when you ask Spotify to do a random playlist which is the definition of not random.,2,2025-06-17 20:22:35

the ads suck now they don't even try to put effort in the actual platform unless you buy Spotify premium so now we just have a glitchey app that has adds every five seconds and just cause they don't make money doesn't mean dip back in like 2020 Spotify was amazing we could actually pick our songs now I only use it bc I'm not redoing my whole Playlist on SoundCloud which is also glitchey.,2,2025-06-17 18:21:39

"UX don't know how to design a good music listening app. If they want to learn they should take a few notes from Poweramp. The navigation is terrible and queues and playlist navigation doesn't make sense. Everything is too focused on content that isn't the music. I don't care about videos or gigs. There is no option to completely disable those features which makes me think that they are not there for my benefit, just as an upsell feature.",1,2025-06-17 18:07:18

"Every update forces you to relearn the whole app because the UI changes on every single update. Especially since the last update the swipe-gesture to add a song to the queue requires now twice the swipe distance to get executed. This is insanely annoying because I am used to the previous distance, which has not changed in years. There is literally no improvement in the UI, only (UX-) breaking changes.

"it used to be great, but since they updated it so that everything needs premium, it's been horrible. you can't turn off shuffle, you can't skip more than 6 songs per hour, and the worst is when I'm trying to listen to a song but they keep playing some other nonsense, for example if I'm trying to play Wayward son by Kansas, it will play dust in the wind and I have to skip several songs just to get to the one I want, and if that wasn't bad enough it almost always needs more than 6 skips plus ads",1,2025-06-17 15:15:45

"As a student who can't afford premium, Spotify has become really frustrating to use. I understand that free users get ads, that's fair. but now it's like we have to pay for everything.

The ads are so loud and irritating (like that BINI ad), and they're even endorsing random products and food. It ruins the whole listening experience.",1,2025-06-17 14:40:19

"Listen, overall I think the Spotify app is great. It functions very well which is rare for apps. However. If you're listening to a podcast that has a zillion episodes like, say, 48 Hours, you have to scroll all the way back up or down to where you are in the show. I hope this makes sense as a complaint. But it is so annoying.",4,2025-06-17 12:42:01

Best app i have used it for hours 4-5 hours but the problem is the premium we can even skip play our favorite song and ads. The best service or solution is premium but if you don't Wana to give no ads best quality don't give but even give us the chance to play our favorite song. If someone likes to listen songs he won't because he cannot play his song or skip his favorite song. so I am telling don't give limits for skip or play our songs. if you can't play or skip what's the benefit.,2,2025-06-17 12:18:31

"Spotify itself is a great app, it has good music and I've had premium for years now. My only concern is the fact they delete random podcasts and it's hard to get rid of them from your library after. I've stumbled upon 🌽 there too and its still not deleted all. They don't listen to their consumers ever. Also, music will randomly stop and I'll have to replay the while song for it work. It will usually take multiple trys. Kinda hope they fix the bugs in their app .",3,2025-06-17 11:44:37

"this app makes it hard to listen to music. Selecting a song to play will instead play a different song by the same artist or playlist.If you ever figure out what the free limit is, an app update then changes how it works or A/B testing puts you on a different UI path (eg. no skip button at all). The app has no in app purchases, only a monthly subscription, and its unclear on all provided features.

Put the music on your phone, add any titles, notes, etc, and bam. You have ad-free music that you won't lose access to just because a company is garbage.",2,2025-06-17 06:40:13

i like Spotify bc (because) of the playlists its makes for your specific music tastes & its great at letting you find new artist from older to new & upcoming artists. i would definitely recommend it to my friends (but they already have it so yeah ! ),5,2025-06-17 06:18:56
there are literally no songs I had playlists and I have no songs in in them when I search there aren't any song just empty playlists clearing data then uninstalling then reinstalling didn't work I don't know what happened I just opened the app some of the song are back but I can't play any of them ok I tried uninstalling then reinstalling for the hundredth time and now all the songs are back and I can finally play them it happened again,5,2025-06-17 06:16:54

"Music selection and quality are great, but the app does not communicate with wifi effectively at all. Very frustrating. When connected to wifi the app will say I'm offline randomly. Refreshing and force closing does nothing, only solution is to restart phone. Also, when disconnecting from wifi and transitioning to mobile data, the app just kills what ever is playing and loses the save state. @Spotify, make a working app that supports the near-monopoly you created or I'm switching to Apple Music.",2,2025-06-17 04:16:03

Spotify's CEOs are money eating pigs. Can't even play songs on this app, it's money making machine! Can't even skip! Can't even choose what to song play!",1,2025-06-16 23:58:28

"You need the premium version for a lot of super useful features (like choosing the music that plays in a playlist) and the ads are unbearable, repetitive and waay too frequent: if these ads were promoting music, ok, no problem (good enough for me), but here it's just commercial stuff that breaks the atmosphere. AT LEAST MAKE ADS THAT ARE RELATED TO THE APP. Basically, the app is not enjoyable unless you pay a lot for the premium version.",1,2025-06-16 23:54:33

advert volume ridiculously loud ! :( it used to be a steady listening platform but now the adverts are plaid at a higher volume and when listening now makes me and others diving for the volume button to put it down. it's basically an audible attack to make you pay for premium service.

Used the app for about 7 or 8 years now and has mostly been great but in the last fortnight or so the shuffle has started being awful by repeating the same 15 songs over and over and over blah blah blahh blahhhh. Usually if I press a random song in my saved library the shuffle starts a new algorithm and new order of songs but its fallen into the same 15 song shuffle which is rather frustrating when I have a couple thousand songs to pick from and I'm hearing a tiny percentage daily Please fix!,4,2025-06-16 18:33:13

There's just constant lagging on this app since they introduced the video feature. when adds come up the app completely freezes. impossible to rewind or ff without the app stalling for ages. A pitty because it used to be a great app.,3,2025-06-16 13:57:10

"the app is good, but i got a comment... about the ""choose songs to play tomorrow"" is too unfair for people using Spotify since we already have ads, premium features, etc. then your making it unobtainable for free users of Spotify when your limiting the use of the app",4,2025-06-16 13:52:27

"some of the things that I like about Spotify is that it shows you your top artists of the month which is good to know for school project and stuff like that. something that I think that they could improve on though is the range of music, I think that they should include more songs from games and indi shows and more stuff like that. but however I do love Spotify and I would recommend to anyone who hasn't tried it.",4,2025-06-16 13:32:36

"spotify is getting worse for free users day by day. only 6 free skips per hour, and you can select a song to play only like 5 times a day. no going back, no shuffle, no lyrics on many songs, can't even add songs to the queue. what the hell is wrong with you guys? it used to be bearable a few updates ago, now it's just annoying to stream music on Spotify. disappointing.",1,2025-06-16 13:26:35

"i gradually watched the downfall of this app from 2018 to 2025. not only they're not letting you skip to any part of the song, but they're also making you watch at least 5 ads to listen to 10 songs. plus, 80 TL for premium features that almost all the song listening apps have for free is definitely not worth it. this app became too money hungry over the span of 7 years.",1,2025-06-16 12:53:30

It's an excellent app. But honestly you guys need to stop advertising so much. This is so irritating and people may end up uninstalling your app. And these days almost every kid including me are using spotify with so much interest. And they won't buy subscription or maybe their parents wouldn't buy it as they would feel it is useless to have subscription whn you can already listen to music. They won't care about Ads and all. Also this recent rule of yours. You can listen to only 5 or 6 songs.,4,2025-06-16 09:17:15

"in the free version there are three advertisements per one, sometimes two, songs. that's like three times the ads then Pandora. Now I find songs on Spotify then create a radio station on Pandora because Pandora stations are so much better. That, and (because there are so many ads), Spotify has motivated me to listen to more local radio. +1 ⭐ for that 🙃 Discover weekly is really cool half of the time.",2,2025-06-16 06:34:47
"So now shuffle doesn't work? Been listening for two hours and it's repeating the same stuff over and over even on a playlist with 3,500 songs on it. How do you screw that up? Just shuffle through the songs. Is it every large companies goal to make every service as bad as possible now? Sure seems like it",1,2025-06-16 06:32:51
"This is an awesome app. The price for the subscription is not too bad and it adds so much more atmosphere to any situation<3 My biggest issue is that you can't have more to said playlists.

"This might be the worst app I have ever laid my eyes upon.

The app has become very unreliable for the past months. Almost weekly it stops working and shows empty playlists and you are unable to use the app what it intends to do. It takes days to be fixed and work again. Even paying users are having the same issue.,2,2025-06-16 04:07:19

"worst music streaming app to ever exist. ads come after almost every song and they last for around 1-2 minutes, making it hell for people who can't pay for premium. you can't pick songs on the mobile version, you only get 6 skips per hour, and the 30 minutes uninterrupted is completely fake. After the recent update, the app stopped working for me entirely, which is why I changed to YouTube music: less ads and unlimited skips even with the free plan. youtube music >>>> spotify",1,2025-06-16 03:52:28

The recommendations are very bad half the time, which is a shame since I always want new music to listen to.

"I really love this app because of the music quality and easy access to new songs. Also, the features are pretty nice. However, there's a lot of annoying stuff about not having premium (which is super expensive). For example, if you have less than like 10 songs on a playlist, Spotify will literally add songs against your will and you cannot remove them until you add more songs. Also, you can't play one specific song, it literally won't allow you to. Recently, there's a lot of ads.",5,2025-06-16 00:57:19

"Good app, but too many limits on free users Spotify has a great collection of songs and the app works smoothly. But it feels like they are forcing users to buy Premium.

"It started off great, but when spotify started gatekeeping lyrics to get people to get premium it got outrageous. When you get 30 mins of uninterrupted listening it's never 30 minutes.

Also, my playlist lengths are inaccurate, I have a playlist with 1,606 songs, yet somehowits the same length as a playlist with 400???Make it make sense.",2,2025-06-15 22:42:28

Constant ads on the Premium service? Recently the podcasts have become full of adverts - on the Premium service - where you pay money not to have adverts. Some are adverts inserted by the podcaster - Spotify please ban this - I've paid not to listen to adverts. But what is really taking the biscuit is that Spotify is inserting adverts of their own.

I have no idea if this is intended or not since when I go to play a song, the ""play any song you want"" icon (the two twisted arrows) which has far as I know is a premium feature. It happened to me twice on two different accounts, so I'm almost certain this is an intended feature on the free version. Until Spotify addresses or fixes this, I can't recommend this.

"Spotify! you are generating the ad revenue whenever we select a song to play. Then what is your problem in allowing the users to listen to a song again and again? Why are you restricting the users to listen to their favorite songs Once in a day? How much ad revenue will you generate if a user uses Spotify for 3 to 4 hours a day? I won't use your app anymore until you fix this issue. Whoever feels this is an injustice to the users, boycott the app until a proper reply from the company.",1,2025-06-15 15:25:45

literally just spotify web but missing all the features behind a paywall. you cant skip more than 6 time in an HOUR. good luck getting that one song while only being able to use shuffle. tbh just download a song player and download your playlists.

I love it and it is fun to have and it has my favourite songs and I can't dj on this app because I don't know how to DJ because I'm learning how to DJ and DJING IS HARD and I now how it feel like because I tried and it was bad but I'm practicing how to DJ me I have two brothers and me so I am the youngest and I am sported and I'm 20 I'm healthy I'm not vaping and not drinking beer because people will die if they do vape or drink because it is bad,5,2025-06-15 11:05:32

"It's much better than TIDAL, Apple Music and Amazon Music",5,2025-06-15 10:57:35
this app is very bad in terms of its conditions like to show adds after each song or blanking the list of songs and many other if not taken premium and this is the reason I think that it is such a useless app for me (yt music) is even much better.,1,2025-06-15 10:57:18

"how tf can we enjoy listening to the app when everything is all in a premium now? before i can choose a music to listen to, but now? you can't even choose it. There's a limit now. There's an ad in every music I listen to. It's so annoying. There was nothing like this before.",1,2025-06-15 10:51:26
It could have been a 5 star but I find it kinda annoying that it doesn't remind you on the app about the premium and when you will lose the premium,3,2025-06-15 10:50:27

Come on people. Be real. You are a MUSIC streaming platform and you CAN'T DO YOUR BASIC JOB!?? WHAT IS THIS SHOW OF MASS CORPORATE GREED!?? I don't understand how people in this world can stoop so low like whichever crackheads run this service. Why can't I find ANY songs? None at all? Why are there only poorly put together playlists from people found in heaven knows where? This isn't deserving of anyone paying. I will switch to a competitor. No one should waste their time on this app.,1,2025-06-15 10:08:24

"This app used to be far and above every other music and podcast streaming app. Recommendations were on point and everything I wanted to hear was on top. I lost my daily mix Playlists. I used to look forward to my Release Radar, but that's also hard to find and no longer exciting. My Discover Weekly used to open my ears to amazing music (See above: cannot find and not the same).

"Spotify is not friendly because they don't offer a premium plan for 3 months with a one-time payment. Think about it. Many users have been using the app for years, and some have even used your app for 8 years.

I didn't want to pay extra for something I didn't even use but wasn't able to cancel it even though it was an add-on that Spotify added to my account.

The app gets kind of frustarting at times due to how much smart shuffle starts playing more songs from random artists rather than from your actual playlist.

it's good but not better than yt music or jiosaavan cuz there are so many ads. and it kinda forces to get premium. it is not what you think it is. It is basically overrated 😐,2,2025-06-15 04:26:51

"I used to consider Spotify the most consistent and useful music app however it's fallen far behind. The fact I cannot even listen to the songs I want to listen to because I didn't pay premium and therefore have to skip past songs until I get lucky and find the song I want is horrible. not to mention the app is no longer functional for me on mobile and no amount of clearing caches or reinstalling or messing with settings will fix it.

"I am unable to set the media streaming quality for music on cellular networks, because the Data Saver setting in Spotify is set to automatic (follow system) but the system wide Data Saver is deactivated yet Spotify seems to think Data Saver is activated.

i absolutely hate spotify. Used to be great but now not even having premium feels like i have no human rights. So many adds like its actually insane. 6 skips an hour which is so like annoying btw and then if im searching for a song and i click on it to listen to it to see if it the one im lolking for it doesnt even let me. like i cant even pick and choose songs. Like for non premium just make it so theres a few adds but not overkill and atleast more skips??? Ong spotify is so annoying,1,2025-06-14 23:45:39

I miss Pamdora. I want to be able to shuffle my radio stations. this app is garbage. I hear the same 8 songs consecutively. im glad my kids are aging out and I will no longer have to pay for this app. the dj sucks as well. he only plays the same 8 songs. and country. I do not listen to country. maybe try and create a shuffle button for the stations. I want to listen to different stuff not the same thing over and over. I miss Pandora.,2,2025-06-14 23:23:42

I love Spotify but I genuinely don't like the update. The reason if because if I want to listen to a song I'm gonna have to listen to every other song in order to get to that specific song.

AWESOME!!!!! I love Spotify but being on SSI it is terribly difficult for me to Budget 12 or 13 dollars a month. I wish they had a plan for people that are on social security or SSI or SSDI. the Gen xers like me love their old 80s music. unfortunately some of us just don't have the money to Budget inn 13 dollars a month ad free. it would be great if you could come up with a plan for people like us and not just students and not just families.,5,2025-06-14 22:06:46

Worst app ever I just purchased premium membership and now I can't use wifi to do anything in the app always showing no internet connection.

"I'm very disappointed at how far this app has fallen. I used to use this app almost daily from 2018-2023. I recently tried to get back into it and was discouraged at every turn. From weird glitches that make all 6 songs skip at once, to having the last song that was playing still on (a week later) when trying to play the same playlist, & all the stuff that used to be free under prime now. Greed will always cripple a conqueror.",2,2025-06-14 18:34:49

Nope gotta listen to a bunch of different ones to get to it then boom ads. Can't even shuffle my playlist without having to need premium.

"It's now making me pay to skip songs. This used to not happen but as soon as I turned 18+ I had to pay the app to get more than 6 skips per hour. I have a concern for this as if there is an inappropriate song playing what if there is a child in the room? sure I could turn it off but what if I'm not there? Plus if the child wants to skip it they couldn't. Not to mention that if you are younger than 18, the app doesn't actually block inappropriate songs to listen to mostly just ads.",1,2025-06-14 09:27:42

Your 'ads' for premium are so unnecessary and annoying. They just ruin the mood. Y'all already have lots of money, so why not give some 'premium benefits' for free?

"love it. it allows me to support my fav artists, at a great price. I promise I'm not a bot, nor am I paid to do this review. it's easy to use, functionality is great. the playlists sometimes takes a few to load but other than that, it's great.",5,2025-06-14 02:57:49
they changed it but I got used to it,3,2025-06-14 02:57:11
"It would be nice if Spotify let you put a bookmark sorta thing in a playlist. Otherwise this is a great app! Also it is not a free app BTW. I have not had any real issues, and I would recommend this app to anyone who likes podcasts and music. I give it 5⭐️. 'Cause it really is a great app! In Spotify you can choose a category when you search. One of the categories should be profiles, so you can search for your friends and follow them!",5,2025-06-14 02:56:02

"Genuinely unusable without premium. And even with premium it only provides the basic features, you pay to be able to use the app",1,2025-06-14 02:54:49
the app has been having a lot of problems lately I had to uninstall and reinstall it like seven times and now it's finally working much better because it wouldn't even let me listen to music and just show me ads non stop for more than an hour. please make the app work better I'm not paying for premium because I think it's a bit unnecessary to price it at that much money especially per month like why not just pay it once every year that would seem so much better.,2,2025-06-14 02:52:22
I just love the app I cannot complain 😌,4,2025-06-14 02:49:11

My favourite part of life.,5,2025-06-14 02:22:49
can't switch all my music over but can't afford premium for a month and the free part is trash just trashy. can only skip like 6 or 8 songs per hour like why limit my skips it doesn't benefit you or give you add revenue they just wanna make it as uncomfortable of an experience as possible. says 30 minutes of uninterrupted music but it's more like 10 minutes it's just all sorts of stupid. got a new issue now it just won't show my playlists songs making the app even more useless,2,2025-06-14 02:21:29

"shuffle. I have over 600 songs, not alot, in my liked songs. when I want to listen to my liked songs and I select shuffle. I want to shuffle all 600+ songs. Not 20 of the same dang songs. Shuffle ALL OF THE SONGS!!. Also the songs you listen to the most is only that way because your shuffle is garbage!!! It plays only the same 20 songs over and over. no matter when I open the app and start a shuffle. or if I try and trick the shuffle. it plays the same songs over and over.

"I think it would be really cool that when you make a spotify jam with people, you can add a little description so when you invite people they can read the description and sort of get an idea of whats going on in the jam. For example, when I make a jam with my friends they all try to just play dumb songs and it can get annoying, it would also be a hastle to text and tell all of those people to stop you know? So instead you could have a description that says ""Play actual songs"" yk? spotify pls 😭",5,2025-06-14 01:47:54

"It is the best app for listening to songs. All types of songs are available here with a wide variety of singers. But one problem is that spotify needs to ensure free use of users all the time.

it always gives ads after every song and is irritating and also doesn't let me play the song for some reason it switches to another song.,1,2025-06-13 23:09:24
Edit: I have since edited this because I've come to find out that even though you pay for premium they limit the amount of hours you can listen to audio books....but don't worry if you run out you can pay a stupid amount of money to give you a few more hours to listen. Spotify is amazing if you get the premium version. Its a reasonable price and you can listen to pretty much any song you want. When you want. If you don't get the premium then stick with pandora.,2,2025-06-13 23:07:12
listening to ads rather than songs👍🏻,1,2025-06-13 23:07:04

"OMG thanks for lyrics!!- The menus have great animations, but when I want to add songs to playlists it feels slow waiting for these animations. - I'd add configurable buttons at the bottom of the now playing page - You can't delete a song from the playlist you're playing it from, without clicking on the album, then pressing the song options and then remove... - If I launch the app and dont wait for the first page to load, just press the music collection on the right bottom, the app freezes",5,2025-06-13 22:37:27

"This app is garbage. 30 min free listening time turns into 3-5 ads after every song , or songs on perpetual repeat . Not to mention the ads are so repetitive,you don't want to ever use the app. Also some ads stop the music completely and you have to physically hit the play button to restart the player . If I could give negative stars I would . They make it so bad to try and force you to buy the subscription.",1,2025-06-13 22:31:29
I can't stand that you can't stop a song. Just pausing it causes it to play the last song automatically every single time you turn your car on. I've turned autoplay off and it still happens.,1,2025-06-13 22:29:19

Absolutely horrendous app. It use to play ads now it doesn't care about it's users. Doesn't allow playbacks and worse you can play a particular song for few times.

"The "" couldn't load the lyrics for this song "" is too mean that am hating Spotify now😔 also it was all good until today, while I playing a song i try to skip it but it not worked a said can't skip because am not a premium holder, then I try to skip back and try to play the from or something by skipping so parts but neither of it worked then I try play another song but it says I have to wait until Tommorow to play another song by my choice",1,2025-06-13 19:13:20

"I would give it more stars, but I find it annoying that after an ad that says to enjoy 30 minutes of uninterrupted time of listening, it isn't actually 30 minutes, more like two songs.

"I genuinely want to thank Spotify from the bottom of my heart. In just one hour, I got to hear 2 songs and 49 ads. What an experience! Sometimes a shampoo ad, sometimes insurance, sometimes toothpaste – full-on entertainment. Songs are just an excuse, the real stars here are the ads! Even YouTube would be embarrassed seeing this many ads. Start a song? Ad. End a song? Two ads. Pause the music? Another ad. Spotify: India’s No.1 FM radio without the radio.

tbh it used to be a great app. I got to listen to all my fav artists and my fav albums from them without any problems whatsoever. but now I cant do that without getting an ad every 3 three song AND i cant listen to the albums I wanna listen to in order without different songs from different artists popping up. so unless u can afford premium I do not recommend this app.,2,2025-06-13 12:48:08

ALSO... why did y'all gatekeep lyrics bro like y'all didn't need to do that it wasn't so serious that it was MONEYS worth?? Y'all are getting way too unnecessary for stuff you have to pay for just to have a easier time on Spotify??? THE ADDS ARE OUTRAGEOUS I PLAY ONE SONG ON MY MIX THEN ADD, 1 MORE SONG, MORE ADDS.

Never been bad enough to make me hate it, usually I just restart the app or try again the next day and its all good, but these glitches have only happened like 5 times in the past year and a half.",5,2025-06-13 09:57:20

"Good, as long as you have premium. If you don't, then the ads are terrible. For the past several months, the mobile app has been crashing randomly. A feature I request is to be able to see the date you added songs to your playlist in collaborative playlists on the desktop website. I also request the ability to loop podcasts. The desktop app opens but never loads anything. Other than that, great app! EDIT: crashes have been much more frequent lately. They restart the song too.",4,2025-06-13 09:18:53

"I've disabled every permission and feature for this app I can find, and it still starts playing anytime I connect to Bluetooth speakers or earbuds. So annoying. I'll likely end up uninstalling because of this. Also notice most positive reviews are one or two words. Probably paid for by Spotify. Also their customer support is no help. a simple Google search reveals countless threads of people complaining about this and Spotify reps blaming the Bluetooth device instead of their terrible app.",1,2025-06-13 06:44:22
Great that in my country it supports pay from phone service. Which is a service that deducts the money from carrier service. But while completing the payment and entering the pin no where is written how much vat it takes on the payment. Took me a while to figure it out by talking with the operator but I think this should be stated in the website in payment page that it takes 15% VAT on the premium cost.,4,2025-06-13 06:39:17

"Spotify keeps going downhill. Now every 3 songs has 3 one minute ads and pop ups. Not only that but its the same 3 ads each time for hours. The Phone version is notorious bad with limiting nearly every feature unless you pay for premium. It was fair for the free version but over the last few years, Spotify has been squeezing every penny out of the app. Tons of songs and lyrics missing. Still full of bugs too. Spotify will not leave the lyrics page up after ads or just changing songs.",1,2025-06-13 06:01:10

GO TO BANDCAMP INSTEAD. this is an absolutely garbage app. fails in every way to function as a music player - which used to come with your computer for free. want to control what song is playing rn? $12/month. want to replay a song when it's over? $12/month. searched a song and hit play but didn't pay $12? plays a random different song instead. got sick of this and stopped paying $12/mo to a service that's not even paying the artists? constant popups about subscribing. NEVER AGAIN. FU SPOTIFY.,1,2025-06-12 22:29:11

"Since when did Spotify make it so, when you search and select a song, it will play a completely different song?

"I'll be blunt, Premium isn't worth it. Don't want ads? Close the app when one comes up and reopen it. (Podcast ads can just be skipped.) Want a specific song and ran out of skips? Copy your playlist a few times and switch to another copy until you get it. The audio quality is completely fine and great in fact! The only thing premium offers that's worthwhile is being able to download your music, but $12 a month for that and features that should be available to everyone? No thanks.",4,2025-06-12 21:19:51

"Technical issues are rampant. Delays in playing, pausing, and skipping songs. Not to mention, running Spotify makes my entire phone shut down. I actually had to pause my music just to get the keyboard to load to type this. This app is slowly going downhill.

"The earlier Spotify was so much better. They've limited almost everything to premium. Before, the songs would play in queue of the album, then they introduced 'Shuffle' which was randomised. It was fine until they then introduced 'Smart Shuffle' which did not have songs which matched each other's vibe at all. After, it suddenly started playing recommended songs completely outside of the playlist which was so annoying. Now they've even limited the amount of songs you can pick to play.",2,2025-06-12 19:51:57

Spotify used to be fair for those even with no premium account.

I was your premium subscriber for last one year till feb 2025 . For some reasons I have not been able to purchase your premium service for next one couple of months but in between these months you guys made my app experience horrible . you are forcing me to take premium again . I am OK with with your ad's in this period but you guys stop skipping songs in queue after some skips which is not ok with me this is too much for me . will never be your listener or user anymore,1,2025-06-12 15:29:44

it's a very good experience with me with Spotify but after some time some issues are there that the team of Spotify sends the message to take the membership forcefully.

I'm not sure if that's something that was taken off in the recent update or if now there's a setting in which I have to set up to remain on.",4,2025-06-12 12:59:32

Listening to music has become unpleasent when every song or two I have to listen to multiple long obnoxious ads from meta. I've been premium and I've been free but I am not sure I can continue to enjoy music in this form. I should add that multiple times I have subscribed to premium I have enjoyed the experience and my roadtrips have been made much more enjoyable and even if my tight budget can't justify it for the rest of the year I cannot question its value as I travel this beautiful country,4,2025-06-12 12:25:48

it's a good app but what I hate abt it when they want to force u into signing up for Spotify premium the app will not play the song u have requested It will keep playing songs from that specific artist but not the one u want that is so annoying telling u to get premium one time I even deleted the app I was so annoyed other then that it is a good app,3,2025-06-12 10:32:10

"They recently removed a feature that lets me auto-remove downloaded podcasts from my device after I complete them. So now, I have to personally go into my download list and tap each item twice to delete it from my downloads, and again to remove it from my list of saved episodes. If I don't do this as soon as possible, one of the other features (that can't be disabled) of Spotify will ensure that the episode will be randomly filtered into my list of episodes I'm trying to listen to in order.",3,2025-06-12 10:05:03

Wow,2,2025-06-12 02:50:26
why can't I cancel subscription ?,1,2025-06-12 02:48:00
"A great mobile app for song discovery and keeping track of your favorite songs. Subscription is a good price, especially if you plan on sharing it with family/friends. Download favorite songs to keep them for offline playing. Collaborative playlists are nice, and playlists are easy to make and keep track of. Great selection of music, old and new, and podcasts. I use this daily for commuting, or to play in the background of other things I have going on.",5,2025-06-12 02:42:35

I have been using Spotify for a long time but nowadays asking for premium for each and everything is not ok.... I don't feel ok paying a premium amount for just skipping the song or to change the song by fixing limits on skipping the song will make a negative impact on your own,2,2025-06-12 02:37:13
"Great app, let's me listen to the music I like. the daily choices are a great item when you want a choice of different music.",5,2025-06-12 02:36:15

the ultimate,5,2025-06-12 02:30:36
"It's not a bad music app but for how much the paid service is increasing for the same 'product' and the lack of opting out of data collecting makes it hard for me to recommend. it's better than other apps but with all my personal info it collects and the data breaches in the Spotify system, I don't feel comfortable.",2,2025-06-12 02:29:40

very nice to listen to music,5,2025-06-12 02:20:56
"After the new updates they really are pushing for people to pay for premium. Too many ads, equal or even than the amount of songs you listen to. If you create a playlist of songs you are forced to listen to the same songs on repeat in order instead of shuffling because they took away the option to shuffle songs. You also can't skip anymore. You get like three skips for an hour. Honestly the whole app got horrible after they started getting greedy, I use YouTube Music now. Much better app.",1,2025-06-12 02:18:05

"in the beginning this was my go to music app. but now? it's not even close. it has gotten worse with time with decisions that have led to the app becoming practically just not what it was before. I know change is the only thing constant, but we should always change to be better, but I don't think taking away years of good features that were under the free plan under a premium, is a change for better.",3,2025-06-12 02:02:52

Overall a great app Though: 1) a cache limit should be added; there's really no reason for it to occupy 9 Gb; 2) there should be a choice of podcast's languages which are suggested at the discover page (alternatively just adapt it based on language of podcasts already added to user's library).,4,2025-06-12 01:34:56

Podcast settings does not work. I can't access settings to delete downloaded podcasts once listened.,1,2025-06-12 01:18:42
"For what it costs, it's buggy and lacks lots of simple things, like linking 2 songs together (Brain Damage/Eclipse, Sirius/Eye in the Sky, etc )",2,2025-06-12 01:14:04
I must say that the audio quality is really good in comparison to other apps but still I'm not really satisfied with the updated version as it doesn't even allow to choose a song of our choice from the playlist and we can't fast forward the song Or choose to play next,3,2025-06-12 01:14:02
Perfect. I love the AI DJ feature,5,2025-06-12 01:11:11

very bad,1,2025-06-12 01:09:23
"Bro, I can't unshuffle my songs without premium on this app. The pc is recommended. Edit: I just found out there's a monthly limit to lyrics. Even youtube music doesn't do that. Way to keep a userbase, they also removed the ability to enable loop without premium.",1,2025-06-12 01:08:39

"So this is a very good app,it's trustworthy and all,although there are some ads,they really aren't a problem,for me they don't pop up much,but the reason why I didn't give this 5 stars is because when I clicked play on a song I liked,it gave me another completely different song,but it also gave me songs made from the same band but different,this also happened to my playlist,the first song didn't play and skipped to like the 8th song.Overall a very good app u should download it,probs the best.",4,2025-06-11 17:21:18

What about adding a shuffle option in the home screen which plays a random song off your library or what ever Playlist that Spotify has made for you? This helps when you don't want to sit there and choose what kinda music you wanna listen to. Also how about we bring back the heart icon for liked songs instead of the tick one? 1 - It is better that way. 2 - You can't tell if you liked a song or it's in one of your other Playlist unless you open the details which is off putting at times.,4,2025-06-11 16:24:38

i rate Spotify with 2 stars just because of its search engine.. almost each and every song i want is found.. but the preference used its a barrier and i regret having spotfy. coz this is not fair. we listen to music using our own data bundle charges yet it want to be updated each and every three days.updates are always a failure. each time we download the app then three days update. all premium features are also fake why. i wonder why Google is still offering this cabbage applications.sad joy,2,2025-06-11 15:44:21

spotify is asking for premium. and its not leting me to keep my favourite songs. its telling that if you try premium.

this app is getting worse and worse. they freaking made everything for only premium members. Normal users can't even replay a song and some random song suddenly playing in your playlist like why the hell did I make a playlist to listen to other songs. And only limited skips per day which is totally annoying . I would freaking rate it in negative but there isn't even an option for it 😔. I totally hate this app.,1,2025-06-11 15:10:07

useless app for exploring music. why is it so difficult to find out what song was just playing?,1,2025-06-11 12:15:54
"very easy to use, and has a great algorithm for what to play for me",5,2025-06-11 12:15:25
"I'll start off with the positive parts if Spotify that I like. First, I love the idea of giving me random songs that I might like. It's commendable how lyrics are available in the songs before. But the very thing that frustrates me is how Spotify limits ehatever songs I want to listen to. Spotify's VERY foundation as a music player is that we can listen to whatever we want. Youtube didn't make us buy premium just so we could watch what we want. That policy is what made other MP3 apps better now.",3,2025-06-11 12:14:59

"It just sucks. On desktop it isn't as bad, but on mobile you only get 6 skips an hour, with shuffle always enabled and no way to put a song on repeat. And if you make a playlist, it starts adding ""suggested songs"" which you probably don't even want to listen to, so you just get stuck listening to longs not even in your playlist.",1,2025-06-11 12:06:49
The way the app shuffles songs sucks. Make an actual randomized shuffle button.,3,2025-06-11 12:05:32

"I have the Spotify Premium Family Plan and recently did an app update and since then there have been double the amount of ads as normal. Because of the ridiculous amount of ads I don't recommend Spotify especially paying for the ""premium"" service.

the best experience with this app.,5,2025-06-11 10:55:36
Not what it was. 30 mins no commercials means 1-2 songs and 4 or 5 long commercials in a row now. I spend more time listening to commercials than a station now. Search function will fail and show no results. Resetting will not fix it. Commercials never fail to appear though. you cant allow it to just play anymore. same commercial will repeat over and over until you stop it making background play worthless.,2,2025-06-11 10:55:27

"I understand with the free version I'm getting ads. Company has to keep the lights on right? They intentionally make the free user experience frustrating by not playing the song you want when you try, instead they add it to a playlist of other songs so you have to skip to reach out. Then they limit you to six skips a day. The app intentionally makes your experience worse to try to pay you into the paid version.",1,2025-06-11 08:52:59

Ads still there even if you subscribe,1,2025-06-11 08:41:08
Really good gets 4★ because I think it's dumb that you have to PAY 💰 to play the song you like okay so if you want to play a song and you click the song it will make you listen to a series of songs before you can listen to the one you want or you can skip but only 6 song an HOUR and if you want to skip more you have to PAY 💰 like idk but I just like YouTube Music more. Sorry but the truth hurts,3,2025-06-11 08:39:23

"Pros: shuffles the playlist when you wanna just listen to a bunch of random songs. Can have a sample of a song, and it also works decently without wifi.Cons: Too many ads, and also it gives you thirty minute ad breaks, and it gave me a two minute one. You can't pick the song, which makes the whole app pointless because if you wanna listen to just one song, you have you listen to another one in a completely different album by the same creator. sure, it works, but YouTube music is way better.",2,2025-06-11 08:07:32

"i don't understand why people love mobile so much. if you don't have premium, it's an atrocious experience - you can't play playlists not shuffling, you can't even play specific songs half the time because they'll shuffle in a bunch of songs you didn't ask for, there's no visible queue, and you can't skip around within songs using the playhead. these are all features on desktop FOR FREE so there shouldn't be any excuses. i'm happy to use desktop for free but this is ridiculous.",1,2025-06-11 07:00:11

I have it on my account, so I logged into it on my other phone BUT I know it doesn't work on the other phone by itself so I normally have both on. But when I tried doing that 10-20 minutes ago and it got rid of my spotify premium like I had never had it before. please reach out to me and give it back. Edit: Nothing works, so now what?",1,2025-06-11 05:52:42
fire app. better than YouTube music ngl,5,2025-06-11 05:52:15
I bought the premium Spotify for a couple ish months and it's so amazing it's amazing as well free but I kept on getting spammed with ads every 3 to 4 songs and it was getting on my nerves but like no joke I feel more then comfortable paying for no ads and and and it has amazing features like blending knowing how close your percentage of taste of music is with others that's literally so cool 😼,5,2025-06-11 05:50:51

"so I'll start with an important issue. spotify is not safe. no two step verification and no security. those who pay for premium are in a severe security issue. With the new an unsuable free mode, only shuffle, no edit, they thought it was a good idea to add their own choices, to your Playlist, so not only do you have constant adds, on shuffle wondering what song you'll listen to..you'll have a song you don't like or don't want to listen to, because they added it without your permission.",1,2025-06-11 05:43:06
"This app is great as a platform to listen to music. This app is absolutely terrible if you don't want podcasts, audio books, or AI shoved down your throat. Each update makes this app worse.",1,2025-06-11 05:41:15
"iv already talked to spotify about the situation, and they will not fix the Spanish problem on the app please fix thank you.",1,2025-06-11 05:35:35
"I want to do two things: open app, find what I want to listen to. Enjoy playing for premium and still having the app offer suggestions for sponsored music that you don't want, really irrelevant and boring podcasts, prompts for family plans, bad suggestions instead of just shuffle, generally get in the way. If you pay for a service, the app should just get out of the way and let you enjoy it, instead of forcing advertising on you.",3,2025-06-11 05:32:36

"I've been using Spotify for around 8 years now and lately I really only use the app to play music through my Xbox's surround sound system that I have hooked up. Lately, it either completely stops playing music or doesn't allow me to play specific songs without reloading the app. It also no longer allows me to delete songs from the queue of recommended songs, nor change their order. When using the DJ, it talks over the first 5-10 seconds of my music. I've made sure the overlap is off.",3,2025-06-11 04:27:03

"I've been using this app for at least 10 years and I used to love it but there have been many questionable and unnecessary updates that kinda ruin the experience. I can get behind most of it, HOWEVER, the shuffle function is literally THE WORST and it has completely ruined my experience. It's not random at all and ALWAYS adds the same songs to the queue, it also forces the ""smart shuffle"" function which adds songs that you MIGHT like to the queue but it's actually just annoying.",1,2025-06-11 02:46:39

I not like it really because if we can not afford premium then it is no sense of using this app. YouTube is the better option for that beacuse there no features if we don't get premium. So I personally feel not to use if premium is not affordable. Please if your money is precious for you plzz don't install this trash. From my side 0 rating if possible,1,2025-06-11 02:32:52

the app is good for premium users only don't waste ur time here if ur not willing to pay there is annoying ads and a limit to the music you can choose to listen and if ur playing ur playlist at some point it starts playing songs that's not even there. if you have YouTube music I recommend I think the free version is better than Spotifys free version,2,2025-06-11 00:05:43
"I personally love this app and I don't really have any complaints but one, Spotify closes out randomly throughout the day and I've tried to look into it and fix it but it keeps happening.",4,2025-06-11 00:04:27

"ads ads and more ads. ""Enjoy the next 30 minutes of add free listening""... 1 or 2 songs later 2 minutes of ads. I listen to music for 8-10 hours a day and have never received that 30 minutes. Customer appreciation obviously isn't a priority. Just feels like they're trying to force me to buy a premium account which I can't afford.",1,2025-06-11 00:00:30
good,5,2025-06-10 23:58:33
I mean everyone in this world users Spotify but the only bad thing about it is the ads like you can get rid of them by paying them but still those who can't afford it have to be annoyed and that's the only bad thing in my opinion.,4,2025-06-10 23:57:53

"the app is cool and all the music and stuff, but the app doesn't work well with other apps. Sometimes u get adds about spotify playlists on instagram etc., u click the link in the Ad and instead of oppening the app it opens the playlist on a web browser, if u want to open it in the app, u have to manually type the name of the playlist which is not always short and easy. For a company like Spotify this should be easy to fix. My phone is not even old its a s23 ultra",1,2025-06-10 23:32:13
"(edit: after a fresh install, I'm still experiencing the same exact problem. So still 2 stars.) It was doing fine, but after the last update, it never remembers where my playlist left off when last used, so instead it either starts the playlist over, or just flat-out doesn't play the next song - UNLESS I open up the queue first. And even then, sometimes the queue doesn't populate. Super irritating, especially if I listen while driving.",2,2025-06-10 23:31:43

"Does not this App have a New Music or New Releases Tap or Folder because i cannot find one....This New Recommended thing...Doesn't do justice because even within genres, the new music listed there its not new or not from 2025",1,2025-06-10 23:31:21
I want to buy the plan but the auto payment policy of company is feel likes cheating as plan will over then if u forgot to cancel the plan it will automatically cut the payment from your bank. Atleast a option should be given on payment screen to keep it off/on. INTERESTED buyer will auto accept. It's need to give option to buyer in easy way so he/she doesn't feel difficult to buy plan.

"excellent app, huge selection of music, has lyrics for most songs if you wanna sing along, and the DJ is awesome from day one dj is my go to listen, though recently it has been getting a little repetitive so I think it may be based on what you chose to listen to and if you only listen to dj, it maybe loses data to base what it should play 🤷‍♂️ not sure but it's still great for mixing it up and introducing new songs",5,2025-06-10 19:59:38

"⭐⭐Star While Spotify is a globally recognized music platform, my experience with the app has been quite disappointing. The audio streaming quality feels subpar, even on a stable internet connection. Frequent advertisements disrupt the listening experience, and the inability to play specific songs without a premium subscription is frustrating. Additionally, the constant prompts to upgrade to Premium appear intrusive and excessive. Overall, the app doesn't deliver the smooth and enjoyable music.",2,2025-06-10 14:25:48

They have monetized every feature possible. You wanna skip a song? Premium. You wanna skip a part of the song? Premium. You wanna read the lyrics of the song? Hell nah Premium. And I'm already ignoring the most possibly annoying ads that they throw our way so frequently. Then they also provide free first 30 mins or no ad streaming so that you can sniff what heaven feels like only for them to stop you from basic features yet again.,1,2025-06-10 14:22:04

This app is definitely amazing BUT i have one complaint. The plans to get premium are quite pricey and if you don't have premium the ads can be a nightmare! I don't mind the ads to much but i keep getting the same ad every time and it can be infuriating. Apart from that its a great app :),4,2025-06-10 13:16:03
"The last update making shuffle stay the same list even when changing the current first song... Is a choice... I find it very frustrating I have to actually click 3 Times to have a new shuffle Add at least an option for that ""benefit"" I ll just lower your rating to 2/5",2,2025-06-10 13:13:30

i just loved it coz my premium plan glitched and now im on premium for like 4 weeks thanks Spotify dont take it back tho😁😁,4,2025-06-10 00:22:00
I pay a monthly premium subscription to this app. I have spent hours with Spotify support to stop the autoplay function in my vehicles. No matter what settings are changed in the app and Android phone it always auto plays. There are many complaints about this but Spotify refuses to put a setting in the app to stop this. It seems it is more important for Spotify to track my location automatically than keeping me as a customer. I enjoy the music and functionality of the app but not autoplay.,1,2025-06-10 00:21:26

I'm OK with the hole experience. There seems to be no feedback button. Why did you remove the like button? I now have to click twice for adding the songs to my likes list. I paid and I get ads for podcast? That's a nono,2,2025-06-10 00:09:03

Very good app. So easy to search for music of your choice and the data it consumes is barely noticeable. I also love the playlist suggestions according to your music interest. I'm changing my rating cause what's the use of paying for subscription and downloading offline if the app wouldn't load my offline playlist without data on. It's a total scam,2,2025-06-09 23:44:28

I wanted to explore free to see if it's like before. I must say I'm disappointed that I can't play my Playlist without smat shuffling it.

"I pay for Spotify premium. I pay quite a lot: over £200 per year. Music is ad-free, but Spotify still inserts ads in Podcasts, which I would not expect when paying for Premium. Yes, I can skip ads, but they are annoying - and the app hides the skip bar for the 2nd ad, after skipping the 1st. If I want to rewind after skipping the ad, to remind myself what was said, the ad is inserted AGAIN at the same time point. Terrible experience. I hope to find a good alternative soon.",1,2025-06-09 19:38:05

Have heard ads I say aren't relevant and also don't always skip things you dislike so you'll be forced to listen to them if you want to keep listening to the same artist. I suggest if they limit the skips you choose they shouldn't apply the same skips to things you dislike. Dislikes should be unlimited skips. No one should be forced to either turn down their phone or have bleeding ears. Sometimes it plays a new ad before my 30 mins of ad free is over. it also shuts down and replays songs.,2,2025-06-09 18:43:45

The free version comes with ads designed to be as obnoxious as possible to bully you into paying for a premium subscription.

"If I'm honest, paying for premium is kinda stupid bc not everybody has the money for it. Yes ik that this app was created to make money from people but paying for premium isn't something EVERYBODY wants to do. Like I'm pretty sure half the people on this planet don't even use Spotify like that no more bc of the fact we have to PAY for premium. And the 1 month free also sucks bc what's even the point.

Another issue is that an ad will pop up and say ""next thirty minutes with no ads"" then one 2 minute song later, it will pop up with another ad. One last thing is that in playlists, they'll add songs, so when I'm looking for a song on repeat, it'll make it to where the other songs play first, and it's really annoying.",4,2025-06-09 10:35:37

Spotify is actually awful. You can't reverse the song or skip to a part unless You pay for it. And it plays the wrong song every single time. You have to pay to even get to the song you want to listen to. Just use YouTube music or newgrounds.,1,2025-06-08 23:18:35

"The app was good for me until I tried others. The app has just downgraded significantly since the last couple of years. You can blame everything about it whether it is their cheap tactics to get people to use premium or the service that they provide when opted to premium. it is totally becoming a mess, torturing non premium users and no value for premium users. The app continuously takes me to old hindi songs even when I'm playing modern hindi Or english songs. I just hate everything about it.",1,2025-06-08 23:11:49

"Shuffle by genre, mood, recommended mix/shuffle by genre, or a random mix of shuffling genres for people wanting a surprise aside from smart shuffle would be great choices.

"it's okay.. sometimes when you open the app you can't play music for a solid 5 minutes, and when you want to change songs, it's super delayed. what I mean by that is you're listening to a song, and then you want to change it, you have to wait a good minute or two for it to change. I'm not talking about after the song ends, I'm talking about when you're mid song and want to change it but obviously have to wait because of the delay. I wish Spotify could fix itself, and it's premium features. 3/5..",3,2025-06-08 19:18:06

This app sucks when you don't have enough money for premium next they're gonna charge us for breathing. You only have 6 skips per hour and after an amount of choosing your own song you can't. Would like to talk to Spotify about this as it is becoming a problem and is very annoying,1,2025-06-08 18:45:46
This app is exceptional. The only complaint I have is we should have the option to be able to remove songs from the local files playlist. Other than that it's fine.,4,2025-06-08 18:40:42
"my Spotify is bugging, i can't play the song I picked, it just won't play instead it started this ad that can't be removed, I've contacted your support service but they can't help, so I hope you can help me fix this or do something to fix this stupid bug, if you won't do anything about this then I'll understand that you're just a greedy company that Forces it users to spend money",1,2025-06-08 18:39:43

I can't even do repeat the song only cuz it doesn't give me the option and I cant ever play the exact song I want to. and when I make a playlist. why is Spotify adding songs to my playlist.

"ive loved spotify for years by now, as i usually rely on it for playlists, nd its actually the only music app i use. but recently, spotify has completely refused to work. my playlists wont load, even if im directly next to a router or anything, and its completely unusable. ive deleted nd redownloaded the app a bunch of times and it doesnt do anything. ive reset my phone and everything",2,2025-06-08 16:51:52
It is the best ever app I've gone through. Firstly it is the treasure of the songs of which we like. It can more better if they can give the feature of downloading the songs without premium. Otherwise this app is good for all.,5,2025-06-08 16:50:20
"Really like Spotify, music and podcasts all together ❤ would recommend to anyone a vast library of media,all for you and you can subscribe and have a lot more options.Two years later still a great app.",5,2025-06-08 16:49:55
the ads are way more frequent and are so annoying,1,2025-06-08 16:49:40
"I have the premium version. This is important to know for something later on. The music is great: no ads, an enormous selection of artists, hundreds of genres, all of this is awesome and really makes the price worth it. However there is one problem: the insane amount of ads on podcasts. Example: on 11:26 minutes of podcast I got 12:00 minutes of ads (6x2:00). You can manually skip them, but it's annoying when you're just trying to listen to a podcast without moving.",4,2025-06-08 16:49:17

"I’ve been using Spotify for a couple of years now, and honestly, I don’t see myself switching. It just gets everything right -from the audio quality, user interface, curated playlists to great recommendations. The premium plan is totally worth every penny. It’s become such a part of my daily routine. Definitely a keeper for life!",5,2025-06-08 16:46:32

Great choices,5,2025-06-08 16:45:55
"Works perfectly for playing music. Spotify has invested a lot of time and effort in making sure that the customer experience is excellent. Two features really stand out for me. Keeping track of what I was last playing on all of my devices is very convenient. No matter where I go or what I do, the music is always available to play consistently. The second feature that I really enjoy is the availability of all kinds of music from all over the world. I love exploring music and Spotify does that. ty",5,2025-06-08 16:45:40

worst app for listening songs and music i don't care about no. of ads you people show but atleast let me listen to my favourite song/music it doesn't even let you choose your favourite song or playlist and shows add after almost each and every song and also it lags all the time even that's acceptable but it goes from bad to worst. it shows absolute dictatorship and each and every time it somehow manages to annoy me everytime by saying each snd every option is only available to premium users.,1,2025-06-08 12:05:41

I get that spotify wants to make a profit, but why have such a tortuous plan? I'd rather them not have it. TLDT: It bugs me that Spotify says they are free, but the free experience is so bad.",1,2025-06-08 01:29:18

"I'll rephrase this. If you follow and listen to a lot of podcasts, then not having the choice to hide the new ones that you have already played, and not seeing the ones that are unfinished on top makes life harder because you have to swipe/browse through all the episodes by chronological order. new episodes did the exact same thing but more efficiently.",4,2025-06-08 01:22:22
this app keeps bugging and every new update added causes the app to bug therefore all 647 songs on my liked list is gone i dont even have the option to look at my liked songs all my playlist skip ever single song in the playlist and then turns off im very upset that i lost all my songs and i want them recovered,1,2025-06-08 01:21:51

I am only allowed to choose a song of my choice 5-6 times A DAY.

"Ads are pretty annoying ! I regret downloading it and now I am just going to uninstall this this.

honestly speaking the only good thing about this app is the songs except for that.. now we have to listen to limited songs only.. next probably will be that we can only listen to one song per day!. I hope that day never comes.. I come from a family that won't pay for this stuff.. and I use Spotify for my studies and whenever I am working on my art piece but because of these limitations i can't even do that. please can you stop these premium stuff... i just want to listen to unlimited music.,1,2025-06-07 19:51:55

"I used the old queue function a lot, & I could select songs and add them to queue, which makes them appear on the top instantly. If I wanted to listen to those songs again I would carry them to the lower section, so they would be out of the queue (since going going back to previous song skips the queued song that was played). Now it's selecting songs one, by, one & I need to take up slowly by scrolling. It's tiring, especially compared to the old version.",4,2025-06-07 18:08:04

"Can someone help me out? My two spotify accounts both have the same problem. when I go on the app, my playlists say they have no songs in them. I have one of 30 hours and one of 2 hours and they both dont work. If I try to make a new one, im unable to because it doesnt let me pick any songs. If I search an artist or any playlist, spotify tells me theres nothing in the playlist. I tried uninstalling and installing, clearing cache, checking for updates and my wi-fi works perfectly fine.",3,2025-06-07 18:01:36

"This honestly a great app, and I really love the large amount of options here for music. My only complaint is, if you aren't using premium, you can't pause nor will the songs play in arranged order. I can't even properly view the songs I have in my playlist. Everything else is cool. It's just that something as basic as pausing or skipping costs money. Plus I'm a minor, so obviously I can't buy premium myself. I hope more people spoke about this.",2,2025-06-07 17:01:27

When im trying to listen to my playlist it constantly plays songs that arent even on my playlist and doesnt for multiple songs afterwards which is really annoying when im trying to listen to songs to the point I got FIFTY SMART SHUFFLE SONGS IN A ROW! I eventually gave up. so pretty much app is useless unless you have premium. Not to mention that one time it played 10 ads in a row before playing a song that wasent on my playlist,1,2025-06-07 16:15:19
"I love the huge variety of music on Spotify. I don't love that I'm struggling with using the app (maybe I am old) to see all the songs on an album. I also am frustrated that I can't do certain things (like shuffle) unless I pay for Premium. I'm not opposed to paying for certain usage qualities, but it seems that shuffle is a pretty easy quality to make free. Maybe I'm underestimating the cost of doing that. Hopefully I'll be able to afford Premium soon.",4,2025-06-07 16:12:50
"Fairly expansive, I've used it before, though resumed recently due to 'vacation'.They seem to pay attention to what I listen to,even the stuff that doesn't always jibe w/ what may be my norm,as I can go off-kilter sometimes.So I give them a""right on, right on"" for knowing what the hell goin' on..",4,2025-06-07 16:12:29

"Oh wow, what a revolutionary music streaming platform! Imagine a place where your free will is snatched away the moment you hit play. Want to listen to your favorite songs? Well, too bad! This app proudly plays what it wants you to hear — not what you actually came for. It's less of a music app and more of an advertisement gallery with a few accidental songs sprinkled in. 24×7 ads? Yes please, because who doesn’t love being interrupted every 30 seconds while trying to vibe? Truly a masterpiece",1,2025-06-07 16:01:45

"Spotify has kind of vaguely sucked for a long time - slow to load, insistent that I'm offline despite being connected to wifi, and useless on desktop. If only there were more focus on getting the core function (playing music!) to work reliably, instead of adding more useless features (who wants to watch a video on an app that can't even load an audio track).

Downloading offline is useless as it requires you to connect to internet to even allow you to play them. The reason being they have licenses for songs that die off every hour on the hour they have to check for because Spotify is apparently run by smooth brains who can't negotiate licensing terms to begin and end on the same day despite the stranglehold they have on the music industry. Sure am glad SoundCloud exists and has the same catalog outside of exclusives even the artists don't want to do.,1,2025-06-07 11:10:55

ZERO STARS Fix this stupid app. I'm about ready to cancel my subscription. If there is a way to stop the autoplay every time a Bluetooth speaker or Android Auto connects it is so obtuse I can't find it. I'm tired of it playing just because I turned my vehicle on or connected a speaker. I even turned off Android Auto autoplay and this app still starts.

"I've been a premium user for over half a year, and the experience has been amazing. The collection of music is good, but there is a lot of room for improvement as well. Firstly, please don't remove songs that are popular, and few songs got completely changed in my playlist automatically, it's annoying. Secondly, a feature that shuffles a playlist after every play, so it avoids repetition, would be nice.

"you need music in your life ,😊",5,2025-06-07 06:45:17
Do not consider it a music streaming app. It's an ad streaming app. You can hear more ads than the songs. Just because you don't have a premium you have to listen tons of ads after literally every song. You can't even choose a song because it gives you an ad whatever song you click on & then proceeds to play song of it's own choice. At this point there are better chances of hearing the song you want to on radio. Would recommend YT music instead. Atleast I can hear what I want. Not some nonsense.,1,2025-06-07 06:41:40

Very buggy behavior between Tesla app and phone app. Phone up will cause Tesla app to stop playing due to one device limit even though Tesla is set as playback device. Usually takes 2 to 3 minutes or fiddling with app to get the app to start playing again. [ Note to developer - start playing song on Tesla app then try open Spotify app on phone. Audio on Tesla app will immediately stop. What should happen audio keeps playing on Tesla app but can be controlled with phone app],1,2025-06-07 02:16:37

"this app has gone beyond boring and disgusting. this app shows ads at every moment and asks to make a premium account. At the end of the day when I want to select my song it shows that I have to get a premium account for that. Also for shuffling my songs also I need to buy premium. Before it gives 30 mins to hear songs, without ads frequently. But now it rarely gives that. But i get disturbed at the end of the day when it shows I can't play my favorite song .

"Spotify's only redeemable feature is their library and their ability to find similar songs/artists that you already listen to, but even that is sometimes scuffed. Outside of that, Spotify is terrible. The most glaring issue is that their audio quality is so bad it ruins music. If you are choosing music to put on in the background, this is perfectly adequate. If you like to hear instrument separation, the emotion in someone's vocals, and all of the nuances of the song, you should go elsewhere.",2,2025-06-06 17:46:06

For example, in a playlist of 100 songs, there are times I only want to hear 5 of my favorites on repeat. I know the queue option exists, but once the queued songs finish, playback just resumes from the start of the full playlist. A feature to loop specific songs would make the experience even better.

Even tho I'm downloading the app from the play store, it feels like i got it from a unsafe site just because how glitchy it was. @Spotify AB please take a look into this and fix it in the latest update.",1,2025-06-06 10:24:22

Update : App has been turned into a garbage for free users as now even more playing songs from playlist its on your playlisted song 10 songs from smart shuffle you cant even skip song.One of the best app just turning into money grabbing app. no basic functions like able to got to previous track on free version .A music app should give user atleast this much of basic flexibility to choose track and go forward and backward in playlist.Or atleast remove restrictions on search and play on songs.,1,2025-06-06 10:12:33

Seems the app has gotten worse and worse since announcing they won't be supporting their smaller creators. UI has gotten significantly worse. While they made clearing songs from the queue it would seem to track those as any time I leave the app in the background and go to the home screen those songs like magic are back.

Changing my review from a five star to a three star. Every time I shuffle my playlist when it gets to the second song it automatically leaves in the middle of the song and switches to Spotify radio for that playlist. Almost every single time. I'm also paying for Spotify Duo which is supposed to include a few extra playlists that are nowhere to be found on my app. Not happy with this as I have been a paying customer for a while now.,4,2025-06-06 06:13:12

not only does this new update make it harder to play unfinished podcasts and podcasts that were released earlier. 90% of the time when I hit play it starts playing random music or podcasts I don't listen to. which means every time I hop into a vehicle I have to fiddle with things to get it to play the right thing. and then it quits playing a new podcast and just starts playing that shows episodes after the current one is finished which means I have to stop the car and fix it again.,1,2025-06-06 04:16:01

Stop hijacking my soundtrack this way, or I'm going with Amazon. ***edit to include response to Devs*** I've been using this app for a decade, and I know the difference between free and premium. The ""14 random tracks"" line wasn't hyperbole, I counted this many before I got frustrated and closed the app. This isn't typical, do better.",1,2025-06-06 04:12:59

I frequently have to connect my data just so my downloaded playlists can play. the shuffle function only plays the same 50 songs out of the 700 playlist. the algorithm just decides artists to recommend me every week even if I've hit 'dont recommend', and now Smart Shuffle is broken, playing only recommendations and never your own stuff.",2,2025-06-06 02:41:06
it was a great music app year before for free users but now it's completely not usable for free users on top of ads you can't even choose the songs you like to listen to more than 5 to 10 times a day. you tube is better than this where you can listen to songs by watching ads.,1,2025-06-06 02:39:19

it's garbage it gives you 10 times more ads than music if you don't pay for it and then glitches the entire time skipping through music and playing music that isn't even on your playlist,1,2025-06-05 23:41:05

Their discover algorithm was good at the beginning. Use for a few years and it just repeats the same songs again and again. I really like the discover playlist until it starts repeating songs. The only reason I used this is the discover weekly. Now it says it's deleted. why does the app start and run in the background when a headphone is connected,1,2025-06-05 23:04:20

Use android notifications to notify of new tracks from favorite bands. Some playlists are missing the hide track button but can still be hidden in other ways. Allow folders to be managed in the android app. Allow the home screen to default to music only. Separate android notifications so I can disable concert notifications. Offer a way to turn a playlist into just a one button discovery of a certain genre or multiple genres but eliminate the Playlist so we don't have to hear the same songs.,4,2025-06-05 20:43:27

I just want to pop in for my semiannual complaints about this app. Reminder that Spotify is spending HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of dollars per year paying podcast hosts but the listening experience is complete garbage. You still can't sort your downloaded episodes the way you want. You still get unskippable video ads on audio only podcasts. The New Episodes page has been deleted. Now you can't even open the settings on the Your Episodes page which won't delete downloads after you play them.,1,2025-06-05 18:29:22

Now I have to save the album extra, go to the album and exclude all the songs I didn't like. And in order to do that I have to listen to the entire album first. It's a huge waste of time and ruins the fun in exploring new music for me. It costs me 14 clicks instead of just one click, how it used to be!",1,2025-06-05 14:47:28

"This app has many ads, I listen to three or five songs and I now have to watch five ads just for this cycle to repeat over and over. not only that, you can't change the order of what music you want to listen to, you can't turn off the shuffle, you can't pick a song yourself and you can't even skip more then I think 6 times. all of those features are behind a 12 dollar paywall! I get Spotify needs to make money but jeez are they making it hard for people who can't afford it. to enjoy the app!",1,2025-06-05 14:17:12

If it is rectified as 20 skips per hour, free for moving to a specific part in a song & can hear songs that you tap is free will be very useful for every Spotify listeners and new listeners.

"I love Spotify the service and wish I could rate the app higher, but it's not without its problems. The Artist radios and playlists used to be great for music discovery, but recently push 'Made for You' content which plays the same few artists repeatedly. How about adding a 'Discovery' option for helping to push lesser known music? Edit: Lowered to 3 since latest update buried the Offline switch deep into the settings.

honestly I get that an organization has to pay its employees so I am more than fine putting up with the adds but do we seriously need premium to add songs to a queue?!?! do better Spotify. other than that tye app is pretty fine. just wish they would add lyrics to more songs though.,3,2025-06-05 02:08:44

Unstable and unusable at this point 30 minutes of ad free music most of the time doesn't work and I get spammed with ads every 2 songs. Playlists won't load songs anymore at all.

Overall it's a great experience it has everything I need. One thing that needs to be addressed is that if it says 30 minutes of ad free listening I shouldn't hear an ad 5 minutes later. I also would like to see more skips available. Lastly when it comes to the price of premium why am I paying almost the same price as a two people account? Shouldn't it be at least half the price of two people?,4,2025-06-05 00:51:01

this app has been experiencing a slow and painful death since they fired most of their staff. I remember finding amazing songs in Spotify owned playlist and the algorithm used to actually play you more than just your top 200 on repeat. I've been using this app since a kid in 2016 and it's just such a shame to see me going to other music apps to get good recommendations for music that isn't just the top 500.,1,2025-06-04 23:43:15

I really disappointed with them about changes.,1,2025-06-04 17:04:51

"they keep changing around the User Interface as if anyone asked for it. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Just because the higher ups think they need to roll out new and shiny updates every few months for the sake of change does not mean anyone actually asked for it.

Then when I go to the actual app, it resets the song! Ruins the mood. And yes, I muted the game's sound so it doesn't interrupt the Spotify songs.",4,2025-06-04 11:29:14

Over the last several months many of the songs that I've been listening to for almost 8 years now have been made unavailable. I'm missing 2/3 of a playlist that is 23 hours long. I'm going to have to go somewhere else soon since Spotify can't keep music on their app.,1,2025-06-04 10:37:49

I use the app mostly for podcasts and it is one of the best podcasts app there is. With their new episodes tab in your library it makes it super easy to keep up with all your shows.

"absolutely horrible app. Not only do we have ABSOLUTELY no freedom of choice to what songs we listen to without premium, but if you do end up listening to the correct song, not only do they start playing random unrelated genres compared to the original song, but they also spam ads, and not even in correct intervals..

"The quality of Spotify's user experience has decreased dramatically. A few years ago, I could listen to music with a little bit of ads. Now, I listen to ads with a little bit of music. I should be able to listen to more than three songs before hitting an ad flood. I'm given the standard, ""Enjoy the next 30 minutes uninterrupted,"" but after only two songs, I'm hit with four back-to-back ads. Additionally, the ads play much louder than the music does.

"This app is absolutely RIDICULOUS. How is it even acceptable that I can’t play the specific song I want unless I pay for Premium? I searched for ONE song and instead I get bombarded with random garbage I didn’t ask for — and I can’t even skip properly without hitting some dumb limit? Spotify, are you serious right now? This isn’t 2005. We’re in an age where basic control over what we listen to should be the bare minimum. Forcing users into Premium by making the free version borderline unusable",1,2025-06-04 01:19:58
"For the love of all that is good and holy, can we get a true random shuffle instead of a hamfisted algorithm that plays the same song twice in a 10 minute span? I've got playlists several hundred songs long that shouldn't have a single repeat song for 16-17 hours, but instead it just tries to feed me whatever it thinks I want. It's wrong most of the time.",2,2025-06-04 01:16:45

Its a really good app. Especially with premium. but that's also kind of the problem. when you don't have premium it's very restrictive. You can't play your songs in the order you want them. and I don't know if this is just me or a general thing but it plays songs not even in my playlist. That's really the only thing keeping it from 5 stars.,4,2025-06-04 00:20:29

"I think you made the app worse with new updates, before you could play playlist in order and I liked that but now I couldn't play it in order, there should be some better options for free users and now you couldn't listen to songs on very high quality too, I think you should change these things after update and glad to know that you heard me and responded !!, I would have given it lower than two but I liked it before that's why I gave 3, update the app for better ratings I guess !!!",3,2025-06-03 21:59:06

What's the point of downloading content if the app doesn't work at all without the internet? Also why are there so many not downloaded content mixed with downloaded ones in the downloaded list? Isn't it supposed to show only downloaded stuff? Also when i press the settings option where you can set to options like custom order it simply closes the app and returns to the home screen on my phone.,2,2025-06-03 21:48:58

so many issues I don't have enough characters to describe it. I love my music so entirely that I need it daily and I am strongly debating deleting this app and moving to youtube. almost the same cost and hopefully it would work better than this. even if I have a playlist downloaded for offline play it still has so many issues.

Removing the new episodes page was a terrible decision. I can handle the new following page if you added back bookmarking in-progress episodes.

"I hate the new podcast feature. It used to play the next unheard episode of my podcast list, now it just randomly picks an old episode of whatever podcast I was listening to so I have to go back into my list and click through my list to find the next new episode. It's also really annoying to have to scroll through locked episodes to get to the ones I'm able to listen to which is not helpful while i try to listen while driving. Please go back to the old method. It was so much easier to navigate.",2,2025-06-03 17:39:13

"I have not gotten Spotify premium and just because they want me to pay I cannot even play a song that I choose. When I select to play a song, it plays another song and says that it is similar to the song I have selected... and in reality it is not at all similar.

What is the use of playlists then??? I am furious.",1,2025-06-03 13:53:34
It's decent but not the best app. Even simple actions like removing a song from liked takes 3 taps instead of 1. swipe to add to queue works on some playlists but not on all. letting the user customise the interface to include buttons we want would be nice. I use the timer alot and it's a 3 tap process.,4,2025-06-03 13:51:03

Today Spotify gave me a 30min ad break, then gave me an ad right after. Stampeding your free users with ads, either makes them get the premium or leave your app. All the other song apps get it, Spotify's only two saving graces are that podcast ads are skippable, and playlists are easy to make.

Every basic feature is locked behind a paywall. I hate the playlist sorting. Sometimes the save button doesn't work or you press it and in reality no changes are made your your playlist. I've already tried clearing the cache and restarting my device. Didn't work.,1,2025-06-03 10:52:23

I've adjusted app permissions and other things trying to prevent this. I have even uninstalled and reinstalled, but nothing seems to work. It is just so annoying.

I'm absolutely gob smacked by the 20 hour a month restriction that you get with premium membership. That's not even an hour a day FCOL. The worst is 20 hours is not enough time too even listen to most books I choose from start to finish without having to wait 20 days to carry on from where you left off. If you need more time it's the same price for your monthly membership for an extra 10 hours 🫢. Come on Spotify! You can do better I'm sure.,2,2025-06-03 04:24:17

"Shuffle is not working properly. Keeps on playing same songs. Especially when the list is too big. This shouldn't be that hard to add a proper randomizer.

Another problem which was recently added to above is that song starts, time also counts but no sound. after some time sound starts. strange..",1,2025-06-03 04:14:30
this is a very good app and has all the songs in the world and mostly because it has original and non original verses of songs which is the best thing ever you have to install it it's the best app of music everrrrr but it just has one problem that you have to listen to a 30 second add and it doesn't stop you have to listen to the song without stopping but beside that it's a very good app and it needs good ratings 👍🙂🙂,5,2025-06-03 04:10:31
thank you i love music,4,2025-06-03 04:06:22
my best app ever,4,2025-06-03 04:03:30
everything needs a premium or ad kicks in after every song and even previous song button requires premium,1,2025-06-03 04:01:04
"Near perfect with premium, my only problem with it is that lyrics sometimes won't show up even with premium. It isn't a major issue as it's only a little uncommon. And I mean when it says ""couldn't load lyrics"", I know not all songs have lyrics lol.",4,2025-06-03 03:47:18
"The app is fantastic.....but the price hike from €17.99 to 21.99, which is a whopping 22.2% (""inflation""....yeah no) is going to be the last price hike I will accept. The next one will ensure cancellation and finding my music elsewhere.",2,2025-06-03 03:46:30

"10 years of use, nice evolution 🚀",5,2025-06-03 03:44:20
use to like this app at most you had to listen to adds every so often but now you need premium to do literally almost anything I can't even skip to the next song without it,1,2025-06-03 03:42:47

Spotify is the best app for songs but the fact is too much ads r there on this app and another fact is u get LIMITED songs to play like wt it's annoying it should be unlimited I have to wait for 24 hours to play another song like I'm done,3,2025-06-03 03:30:50

"I measured, every 2 songs it gives me 3 minutes of ads. It also gives me a pop up everytime I get into the app and it makes my phone run super slow. The app has all kinds of music but too many ads and they keep repeating and are not relevant to me at all. I recommend Trebel music, little to no ads and free offline listening.

"FYI: if you lose your premium, they delete your entire playlist! even goggle music doesn't do that! Not worth the money you pay to listen. Plus, there is more music on google music too. To Spotify regarding my review: Since you can only authorize certain music, then you should lower your pricing arrangement. you charge the same price as google music but don't offer nearly as much as google. And while I normally don't promote companies, google music has been really good.",1,2025-06-03 02:59:10

"The app plays music automatically when it connects to the car bluetooth with no in-app option to disable that, and please don't say it can be disabled from the car because what if the car is old with no android auto then there's no option to stop this!! and this option is present in other music apps, so there's no excuse for not having it in spotify",2,2025-06-03 02:31:45

"Spotify is a great online Music streaming app.... But the thing is that Spotify is slowly turning everything towards Premium, which makes it so much irritating. It doesn't even allow you to skip songs anymore, urging you to buy a premium plan..... The old Spotify was much better where anyone can enjoy the same melody of music & songs. This system of Premium divides people and makes you wanna quit the platform....My Humble Request is to reduce these restrictions from the app.",3,2025-06-03 01:10:16

it's ok but you only get 6 skips an hour I personally think that you should get as many skips as you like but a premium feature is that you get to use it offline but other than that it takes a while to find the song you want because it is a premium feature to get your song at the exact moment you want it but other than them few things it is actually an ok app I'm not gonna lie I do prefer sound cloud but yes its a good app,3,2025-06-02 23:05:52

the recent update is terrible - the podcast feed is a mess now showing me old stuff I've listened to. There are constantly issues now with segments repeating when I switch to my smart speaker. Not impressed at all!,2,2025-06-02 21:53:53
no longer worth it. ever since I upgraded my phone to S25 the repeat feature stays on. when I turn it off it turns itself back on. I've reported this Spotify multiple times but no corrections have been made. if I'm going to be paying for services I might as well change streaming services,2,2025-06-02 21:53:33
Very good but some of the songs doesnt have translation like example: lisa or liza by ksb muzix,4,2025-06-02 21:52:00
it's a good app but everytime it update its always disappointed me because of the premium. i think the community is hunger for money.,2,2025-06-02 21:50:50

It would be better if they supported the lyrics offline because it's useless even if you download the song if you still need to be connected to the internet to display the lyrics.,5,2025-06-02 21:41:33
very great but the skips and choosing songs shouldn't be limited.,3,2025-06-02 21:40:37

"It has become less useful for podcast listening. The feed is moved to the front page. It's sorted from new to old, it can't hide finished episodes, and I can't skip. What it means is that you could miss some episodes or play already finished episodes again and can't skip what you don't like unless you manually make a Playlist every time. It's also constantly playing another podcast when I hit play. The ""now playing"" isn't what's actually played. I captured the screenshot to prove it.",1,2025-06-02 20:54:20

"The app has a tendency to lag when playing long playlists. It would stutter for 2-4 seconds before, but now it hangs completely for 15 seconds whenever I begin playback, or even go to next track, which doesn't make sense if it's determined the queue already. Please delegate queue generation to the server. It's obviously all happening on the client and freezing the UI thread due to how resource heavy the task is, randomising the order. It also ignores the custom ordering of queue tracks... buggy.",2,2025-06-02 01:39:26

Ok for music but terrible for audiobooks. There are now better options for music however. Limiting your audiobook listening time is down right criminal when it requires less bandwidth than the unlimited music. Top up your listening hours indeed. Creating an artificial product by limiting what should have been included then charging extra for it. You have to pay extra to listen to the audio books you downloaded with the app itself and are being stored on your device!! Ridiculous.,2,2025-06-02 00:44:47

if you guys spent less money on marketing and UI changes and more on actually making sure your product works I would give you 20 bucks a month. you guys are seriously so incompetent that you can't compete at the low price point without annoying your customers. you can't even compete on the top end because you're too cheap to hire good engineers. you continuously want growth when you can't even sustain what you have.,1,2025-06-01 23:55:13

However I like having spotify It's helpful. I still only stream music on here, sometimes on youtube but this is the one I like best.",3,2025-06-01 22:19:49

"Spotify’s been my go-to for years now. The playlists, the recommendations, everything is just on point. I discover so many new songs without even trying. Super easy to use, clean interface, and it works smoothly even on average internet. Offline downloads are a lifesaver for travel. Honestly, once you get used to Spotify, there's no going back. Just hit play and vibe.",5,2025-06-01 22:09:29
"This used to be my favourite application for listening to music, but now they're so desperate for money that even trying to do basic things like skipping a song needs premium. Absolute waste.",1,2025-06-01 22:09:23

"Every single feature is behind a paywall nowadays. I've signed up for the free trial, IT WAS NOTHING SPECIAL. Why should I have to pay to skip a song? why should I have to pay to choose which song I want to hear? Why should I have to pay to not hear 5 ads every 2 or 3 songs?

I don't like the updates it get worse every time. Old versions were better. Want the good old simple classic features. The made for you playlists are nice. Can't u guys limit the ads? And keep the 30-minutes- interruption-free-if-you-watch-the-ad promise? Suckers. We need a select-multiple option to select multiple songs to add to playlist. That's really a need! And u should have hide song feature for our own personal playlists too,1,2025-06-01 21:49:58

"Too many ads, can’t skip songs, and shuffle is forced — what’s even the point of a music app if I can’t choose what I want to hear? Every tap feels like a trap to push me into Premium. Even podcasts have ads now! The free version is basically a demo — useless unless you pay. Not user-friendly at all unless you buy Premium. Feels more like a marketing tool than a music app.",1,2025-06-01 21:14:10

After logging out,reinstalling it did fix the issue but for a short period.Now that song is back again. Edit: I've been listening and liking just the music I like, I have not even searched for that genre. This is a bug. Fix it!",3,2025-06-01 17:16:18

Its been doing this usually after 5-10 minutes but now that it happened that quick I realize I'm not forgetting I listened to stuff but it really is off.

"Spotify Free is borderline unusable. The constant ads are bad enough, but only 6 skips an hour on playlists is infuriating. You also can't skip through the timeline of a song, forcing you to listen to entire tracks you don't like. It feels intentionally designed to frustrate you into paying. If you're not going premium, please don't install the app",1,2025-06-01 15:18:39

Spotify is lucky I still like using the app when I have their free trial for 3 months it was actually good but after the 3 months came I didn't pay and it put me back to the basics and I really hate the basics because a rearrange my whole playlist which I purposely put in an order to my discretion and I don't like you use Spotify on my phone because it adds random music to your playlist and some of the songs I don't like and when you don't have premium you got a lot of ads Spotify is lucky,1,2025-06-01 11:17:57

"I'm deducting stars because it's been 10+ years & they still haven't fixed a lot of simple problems, particularly the online & offline modes. It's pretty rare for the app to actually recognize that you're on WiFi. I constantly have to go to the home screen, then settings, then turn off the offline mode because 99% of the time that I'm on WiFi, Spotify continues getting worse. I clearly don't have nearly enough space to write down all the problems & new & bigger problems keep coming each day",2,2025-06-01 07:37:31

"I want a offline downloading app but this app is not for offline listening bcz of their Premium Spotify I'm just only 13 years and I don't have my own Credit card 💳 that's why.

I don't know what to I do? 😞",1,2025-06-01 03:47:01
The latest update has made all the music sound low quality and screechy at louder volumes. There's also a weird fade out when pausing music. Changing streaming settings doesn't help. It doesn't do this for any of my other devices but I know it's not an issue with my phone because every other streaming service sounds normal.,1,2025-06-01 03:45:00

"I use Spotify for podcasts in my car. What's lame about the latest version, is that in Android Auto when you search new episodes there's an A to Z menu, but the alphabetical search is based on the title of the episode not the podcast itself. So you can't search for ""All In Podcast"" by pressing ""A."" You need to know the title of the individual current episode, which is impossible. Not good!!!",2,2025-06-01 03:21:57

The most useless app ever... if you want to listen the song for your peace of mind never play spotify. it will just play the ads every time... they plays ad more than song... you will get frustrated instead of feeling peacefull if you listen song from this app....

"Spotify is just absolutely horrible now.The free experience is the most frustrating thing ever with one ad after the other non stop, completely ruining the purpose of a streaming application when you're listening more advertisements than the actual content itself.EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU CLICK ON A DIFFERENT SONG AN AD POPS UP.Even the Ads which claim to give you 30mins of free listening scam you,scummy move Spotify.",1,2025-06-01 01:46:36

"Enjoyable, but advertising annoyance!",5,2025-06-01 01:42:58
Ridiculous. Unable to play other songs without the premium. Greedy. You can just put the Ads before the song instead of not allowing to play the music at all. I don't Iike to renew my premium. Can't play the podcast in order and no option to delete the podcast history etc. Lack of features. Unsatisfied.,2,2025-06-01 01:40:02

"Unfortunately the app has entered its enshitification stage now. Moving new episodes to the podcasts tab has made it virtually impossible to find new episodes in the Android Auto interface without a lot of scrolling, which is obviously no good while driving, so you can either listen to one new episode per trip or have to prepare a play list for each trip (or have a car accident). So no great options.😂",2,2025-06-01 01:29:09

"I’ve been using Spotify for the past 3 years, and honestly, the experience has gone downhill lately. The number of ads has become way too much — they interrupt almost every few songs and completely ruin the vibe. It’s really frustrating. Also, the music quality in the free version seems to be decreasing over time. It used to be my favorite music app, but now it's just not enjoyable anymore.

After pressing + it's adding it to the sleep/lullaby playlist I made, not Liked Songs. It happens when (ony my android) I pull down the little notification panel, and try to press the + sign on there, not in the app. I hate having to see the Picked For You vids play automatically.

it the best app for music lovers because you can listen songs or else if you have any work on your device you can do it because spotify gives you background play so just if you play song even if you lock your mobile also song will be playing so i keep song in the background and do my project,4,2025-05-31 22:32:52

I love Spotify it's always a reliable music app . Honestly I don't need any other apps for my music. Even if you don't buy a subscription you can bump music all day with hardly any ads and if you subscribe like me there's no ads at all . You can easily save and download music to your phone or other devices. If anyone is reading this just give it a try and you'll see what I mean .,5,2025-05-31 22:19:25

I pay my subscription to enjoy the music I like. If you're going to force something else at me, why don't I just listen to free-to-air radio?",2,2025-05-31 19:51:40

"Spotify is incredibly exceptional, Although you've made your app completely pointed towards premium. i have to pay to pick songs, i get 6 skips per hour. I have been a user since the mid 2022-2023s and the free features has been limited because of your greed. Perhaps you could limit those premium features because peoples are already switching towards other music apps, Spotify used to be iconic and trendy but it's just popular for its premium features now.",2,2025-05-31 18:39:10

This is great for music but when I get ads it says that I will have a 30 break from them. yet i get an ad immediately after the next song. In general there are too many ads. Yes I do understand that because it is a free account we need ads but this is too many ads,4,2025-05-31 18:04:26
good so far !,4,2025-05-31 18:03:24

"I love spotify and i've been a premium subscriber for 4 years. No major complaints about this app, except the fact that the free version is absolutely terrible, the search feature is now broken so instead of seeing songs with similar letters, you just see pre written searches, and finally, the audio quality is often behind competitors. Still, I enjoy using Spotify and have no real incentive to switch. Searches also have some sort of loading time as of 31st May 2025, which I think is annoying.",4,2025-05-31 17:10:20

"Very bad, the app gets stuck often and stops singing even with a paid subscription. there are many artists pages that don't open. when you subscribe they charge your card multiple times and only refund the one you contest with your bank then cancel your subscription no matter how many times they debited you. and their customer care reps are very rude and unhelpful. a very, very bad experience",1,2025-05-31 16:07:05

needs premium for the basic interactions in the app I'm fine with ads but play in order being a premium special or shuffle and reverting back to the previous song also being a premium And when your trying to listen to your playlist/album after the first song it will go to a whole different song that's not In your playlist OR ALBUM,1,2025-05-31 15:30:04

"I love Spotify when it comes to finding new music as well as building personal playlists for me based off of my listening. What I'd love to see is an easily accessible EQ on the music player screen.

"All of a sudden I can't search for songs. logged out to refresh the app, now it won't allow me to login, it just says ""something went wrong, have another go"".

So I just found out that if you're on a free plan with this app it puts your selections in shuffle mode and you CANNOT turn it off. No matter what song you select it will pay anything besides that. WHO APPROVED THIS? Do yall think p!ssing people off would make them want to spend money on the premium plan? I may as well just create my Playlist on YouTube 😒,1,2025-05-31 12:15:34

"I used to be a music lover. Spotify has made it mandatory to get premium. You open it and you get a long ad. You can't even quickly listen to one particular song that could help lift your mood. With layoffs happening all over the world, and people becoming jobless, Spotify forces recently jobless people like me to spend even to listen to a single song. It's like the Black Mirror episode 'Common People'. Enjoying music is a natural instinct and you are making people give up on it.",1,2025-05-31 10:46:56

Why raise the prices? At this rate I'm better off with CD's. Also explain to me why I get 5+ advertisements after ONE or two songs (if I'm lucky).

If there a way to edit playlist other than to add or remove songs one at a time then it is very non-intuitive. so this app isn't very bad unless you have or want to listen to a lot of music then it's awful. stuff all over the place hard to add or remove or rearrange things it's a hot mess.,2,2025-05-31 06:35:11

"Great music Definitely recommend. Love the Spotify Wrapped at the end of the year. I don't like the new plus button I prefer the heart and separately add it to my playlist. Also please make the explicit filter so that everyone on a premium plan can manage their own account in full, the plan manager shouldn't have control over everyone's account. Please don't mark songs explicit when there not like Patience by Guns N' Roses follow My Music by Edmund playlist for tons of different music.",5,2025-05-31 03:48:48
"Been on Spotify since the day it went live in the UK. literally the best thing that ever happened to music in my life. my one criticism would be, if I am listening to a song there is pretty much no reason I would ever want to stop that song and jump to another one just because I accidentally pressed the wrong thing. please add an option to pop up a box that says ""are you sure you want to stop this song"" before you jump to another one",5,2025-05-31 03:46:10

"Great for listening to music. It does keep crashing a lot though. Usually when I use another app while it plays in the background, but I do have an older phone so that could be why.

"Manic with the ads. 3 ads in between each song.

The shuffle algorithm is useless. I have well over 1600 songs on one of my Playlists and I keep hearing the same 20-30 songs on shuffle. Why even have this feature?,1,2025-05-31 02:51:14
great music streaming experience,5,2025-05-31 02:47:08
"just about ready to cancel after having a subscription for years. I don't know if AI is messing with the algorithm, but creating your own playlist is useless now as it is hijacked by whatever the app feels it should play next. this is extremely frustrating when you are on the road and you just want to be in the flow of your music, and it switches it to something continuously that you would never would listen to. not sure if it's a bug, but it's been ongoing for several months,",2,2025-05-31 02:46:04

"I'm happy with the new layout amd the fact you can of current actually play the song you press on and not a playlist, and how you can as of current play a playlist without Spotify adding on extra songs. I love the loop button. I hate the playlist sorting. Sometimes the save button doesn't work so you have to redo everything you just did. Sometimes it moves your songs around.",3,2025-05-31 02:30:17

"I keep getting a ""beta test"" for app-pushed ads despite having spotify premium and despite the company saying they have no plans to bring ads to premium.

"Premium subscribers looking 4 Android alternative: Apple Music app is now available on Android. Family plan $16.99 w 1 month free trial. Antennapod app and Apple Podcasts through my browser.

"I'm a premium member and have had nothing but problems trying to use Spotify for audiobooks. From constant glitches to being cut off mid-book, the experience is just plain frustrating. It’s clear Spotify wasn’t built for audiobooks, and it shows. It has poor chapter navigation, and I’ve lost my place multiple times after switching devices or closing the app. The 15-hour monthly limit is annoying enough, but what makes it worse is being cut off mid-story with no warning.",2,2025-05-31 01:38:04

Gee, a simple notification of this would have been nice! And besides, why is your app so hopelessly sluggish when data is obviously turned off, where it is waiting on data to navigate things smoothly?

"The best app for streaming music or podcasts, by a long shot.",5,2025-05-30 23:51:38
"Spotify is a great platform for streaming music, offering a wide range of songs, curated playlists, and a user-friendly interface. However, the app occasionally hangs during use, which affects the experience. One major issue is that when switching playlists, it doesn't save your progress in the previous one—making it hard to remember which song you were last listening to. Fixing these problems would make Spotify much more reliable and user-friendly. Thanks Spotify devs for great music. ❤️",3,2025-05-30 23:47:12

"I like Spotify, is the only app in which I can listen to music with the screen off. BUT I HAVE LIKE 9 PROBLEMS! When you create a playlist, the app adds a song that u don't like or don't know and that's pretty annoying. You can't do a lot of things like skip songs that THEY PUT IN YOUR PLAYLISTS bc you can only skip them 6 times, you can't choose the song you want because they will put others, all of this is bc you don't have Spotify Premium, and there's more but I wanna know if it can be fixed",4,2025-05-30 19:53:47

Oct. 17 update: so they managed to make the app even worse. Good job👍🏽 App just feels outdated (specially UI wise) campared to the competition. We get half-assed updates here and there but nothing fixes any of the issues that already exists. We been asking to remove the black bars in the top and bottom of the app for years and it still haven't been addressed. I guess it's time to switch to Apple music or YT music.,2,2025-05-30 19:39:14

"I'm absolutely loving this music and podcast app! The audio quality is top-notch, and the data-saving mode is a lifesaver when I'm running low on data. What really sets it apart, though, is the positive impact it's had on my life. It's more than just an app - it's become a valuable part of my daily routine.

"Most of the time the app works fine. However when I add many songs to the queue and stop playing to take a phone call or take a break from listening, when I go back into the app the queue clears and the player closes in front of me. Haven't had this problem on Tidal or YouTube and it's genuinely so infuriating to spend a time making a fire queue of 50+ songs only to lose all that work.",3,2025-05-30 18:58:55

"Useless Without Premium Spotify without Premium is basically useless. You can’t skip songs, you can’t pick the song you actually want to play, and everything is just forced shuffle. What’s the point of having a playlist if I can’t even play the songs I want? Feels more like an ad machine than a music app. Unless you pay, you get a broken experience. Super disappointing.",1,2025-05-30 18:52:53

"Used to love Spotify but the free version is now unbearable. Ads play after every 1 or 2 songs, skips are limited, you can't play specific songs, and shuffle is forced even in your own playlists. The app constantly pushes you to upgrade which gets really annoying. It feels like the free tier is designed to frustrate users into paying. If this is how the free experience is meant to be, it's just not worth using.",1,2025-05-30 17:44:42
fantastic,4,2025-05-30 17:42:56
"Overall great experience! 7.5/10 I only have 2 issues with the app in particular: 1. Spotify reinvents features sometimes and it makes the app harder to navigate/less intuitive for seemingly no reason. Smart shuffle replacing the enhance feature is an example of that. 2. They often break the app for a few days after every update. Idk if the devs are just not doing tests before pushing updates, but it does get old pretty quick. The issues I see tend to be widespread across many users/devices.",4,2025-05-30 17:38:57

"The recent UI changes on both the mobile app and Auto look bad and feel clunky. As a long-time premium user, I'm displeased. I do not enjoy that the library button was moved and replaced by the 'Create' stuff. On the Auto app, playlists are still not sorted by how I have them displayed in app, which means spam-clicking on a invisible scroll button to get to the bottom of the playlist (or being obligated to use my phone to select the song)..",3,2025-05-30 14:23:23

I'm okay with listening to ads but I like most the features on premium being able to queue songs but I can't get premium. why can't I have some of the feature of premium the minor ones like being able to queue songs and pick the song I want to listen to in the moment. overall pretty good but needs to be better.,2,2025-05-30 11:27:09

the worst music app ever. wanted to listen just a song and had to listen 4 to 5 advertisements even after every song there are two or three advertisements just after every song like they just want money and the premium otherwise they'll give you only advertisements to listeners.

I'm going to give this app 2 stars because it's not the same and I can't even play the song I want because it always goes to a different song and I want to play the song all over again I want to do that but I can't and it's not the same,2,2025-05-30 09:24:38

"the shuffle feature isn't a true shuffle but instead incorporates some stupid algorithm that Spotify thinks is more capable of deciding what song I want to listen to than I do. I have about 900 songs on a playlist and when I shuffle all it cycles through only 200 ish of them. I am burnt out of those 200 songs I hear them every day, while there are several times more songs I haven't heard in literal weeks. This ""algorithmic shuffle"" cannot be toggled off, you HAVE to use it if you want to shuffle",1,2025-05-30 09:03:35
"it's just the fact I HAVE to pay in order to go premium, it's the same for YT music except it's more expensive and I would LOVE to go premium for both but I wouldn't know how to pay in 100 years if I wanted to anyways",4,2025-05-30 09:03:10

"App is getting worse and worse by the day. Used to just start my car and it would start playing automatically, now it plays an ad then freezes so I have to close the app and reopen it, when it reopens it plays the same ad 3 times in a row before playing a single song and then playing another ad. Don't say to get premium, I had premium for 2 years and it's just not worth it. It's sad to say that Pandora is actually becoming better than Spotify",1,2025-05-30 07:27:28

"The app has been down for months. No amount of reinstalling, resetting the phone, clearing cache, online forums looking for solutions have been able to let me listen to music at all. I've been extremely irritated and wanting to at LEAST see all my songs so I can just download a different app. It only shows a couple of songs I can play out of the 300+ songs I have but then they immediately disappear. Nothing but a black screen and maybe a song or two but you can't even play them.",1,2025-05-30 06:09:59
i want to delete my account because it is always automatically deducting on my gcash account. I'm not even using it. So please allow me to delete it. The app says there's a problem but I've been trying to find where I can locate it. God damn it!!!!!,1,2025-05-30 06:08:45
It's impossible to dislike offerings and remove undesirable music from my feed. They should include an option to ban artists and music styles from the suggestions. I open up the app and there's an detestable artist shoved to my face. No one wants that. 1/5 stars.,1,2025-05-30 06:07:00
I would rate 5 IF you could download songs to a flash drive or computer hard drive,4,2025-05-30 06:06:28

The app itself is good. But for God sakes stop with the commercials that have people slurping their drinks! No one and I mean no one likes that niose. It's possibly the most offensive noise ever. I refuse to buy any products with those types of commercials.,3,2025-05-30 05:35:32
will Spotify ever make a light version? my eyes are not that great and during the day this would be helpful to see everything and so I'm not squinting at a dark screen in the day time.,5,2025-05-30 05:34:07
I mainly use it for short stories and podcasts. Excellent variety.,4,2025-05-30 05:29:20
It randomly started skipping songs before they finished. I have never had an issue until last week and it is extremely annoying. Why pay premium if I can't finish listening to a song? Going to cancel my membership if this isn't fixed.,5,2025-05-30 05:20:59

"The move to change ""New Episodes"" from your library (easy to find, user friendly) to the homepage (harder to find, not user friendly) is a bad one.

"Most terrible music app highly highly overrated in this time period for some reason that everybody uses and the only one you can download on Xbox for some reason.

"Do you think that I can afford Disney, if I can't afford Spotify premium? Seriously the nerve. There's no more 30-minute free of ads offers. Some songs you can't preview & it's extremely hard to create playlists because you can't click on the albums to view or add the songs anymore. The app is less & less user friendly as the months go on. I'm afraid to update it.",1,2025-05-30 03:17:39

"It is ridiculous that I get ads before and during podcasts when I pay £16.99 per month for Spotify premium. The app is good for music, but a joke for podcasts. I listen a lot more to podcasts than music lately, but seemingly get the same experience as those not dishing out over £200 per year. Will revert back to five stars when the ads get removed, and will look for an alternative platform altogether if not.",1,2025-05-30 02:57:22

Changed my comment since last time since more info came to light. However! You're the biggest music app on the planet. The bugs are starting to get annoying. Controlling another device shows a completely different song playing as example. Edit Your UI is going backwards in intuitive design and your policies for music artists don't rub me the right way. Also... I can only pin 4 playlist a in total?.. I am literally paying you guys. One star. 0 if possible. Will move away from Spotify when I can.,1,2025-05-29 23:49:01

"Since the most recent update, trying to play music results in Spotify playing 1 second of each song in the playlist before skipping to the next song. after about 30 seconds/songs it crashes. The only way I've found to fix this is to uninstall the app and reinstall it. it's happening multiple times a week and I'll only know when I try to play something. It doesn't matter which playlist I choose, it does it for all of them until it's reinstalled.",1,2025-05-29 21:52:12

The songs are the same thing and I am having trouble just listening to singles songs and has to require a lot of songs. I just don't want to get premium because it is expensive and I just don't want to do it. It is fine all along now but could use a major changes in the songs and the artists.,3,2025-05-29 18:31:40

"Great app, but the unpaid version is so restricted now that it becomes very difficult to use it. One cannot listen to songs in the same order as in their playlist in the unpaid version.

"Don't ever try to Install or use this #spotify app for music. It's a purely advertising app in the name of music. They ask to subscribe and they grab the penny and they never sought the issues of subscriber & non-subscribers users. Let me tell how Spotify ads app runs - 1 song, 3 ads. If you lock your phone to listen music, again a ad will be display on popup on screen when we on the screen. Advertisement on the lyrics section when we back again. Better stop songs, podcast run Ads #adskabapp",1,2025-05-29 09:58:22

if you download a podcast then try to play it while online Spotify will splice in their own ads on top of the ads already in the podcast. the exploration features are disappointing and they took away the functionality that let it play audio from your phone. fine if you've got specific songs you want to listen to but if you own them you'd be better off just using a regular media player.,2,2025-05-29 09:29:56

their schemes are a big scam. for offers claiming 3 months Spotify premium for rs 59/- please read the terms and conditions as this company is straight up lying. there are no premium benefits at rs 59. it's only after you pay 119per month do these benefits start.

"Fake Ads! Every once in a while, I'll get an ad saying that I can ""now enjoy 30 minutes of uninterrupted streaming."" This used to be a thing. Not anymore. I always get more ads after the next song, and then more ads after that. I never get my ""30 minutes of uninterrupted"" music, I barely even get 3 minutes of uninterrupted music!

I have the family plan, and it's cheap for the automatic stuff they do for me. They'll make playlist suggestions based on what my likes are, or what I listen to the most. Then there's DJ X.

"I love the music and it's my go to for music but the ads are getting to be a but much when I get told enjoy the next 30 minutes of listening and then without slipping any songs and staying on the same play list I get 2 minutes worth of ads. also, sometimes the amount of ads back to back adds up to a whole songs worth of time and irritates me to no end.",3,2025-05-29 00:22:40

The music constantly stops mid song and starts a new song and some family members can't access their own playlists. We have to share them with someone else in the family to play them on Bluetooth speakers.

"Paying for premium still has content not available without an additional subscription - no option to hide this content. With auto play turned off, it adds already listened to podcasts into your queue, and adds them back even if you manually delete them. No way to tell it to never show you certain podcasts from things you have no interest in. Can't remove a podcast it automatically played (with auto play turned off) from something I have no interest in and it's using that to make recommendations.",2,2025-05-28 23:59:33

"Spotify Free isn’t a music app — it’s an ad machine. Two songs, then bam, an annoying, repetitive ad begging you to pay. No song choice, shuffle-only, and a six-skip limit that feels like a punishment. Ads are loud, nonstop, and kill the vibe every time. The app crashes, burns your data, and constantly nags you to upgrade. Spotify clearly doesn’t care about free users — they just want your money by annoying you into submission. Fix your free tier or lose us all to better apps.",1,2025-05-28 23:55:20

"I'm a heavy user of Spotify and I couldn't live without it, I absolutely love it. I like how when adding a track to a playlist you can see what other playlists you've added that track to. Just discovered if you click on the '+' next to your 'Profile Name' in a playlist you can see how many tracks it contains. Would like to be able to sort Albums in library so an Artists' albums would show in chronological order rather than alphabetical. Premium user",5,2025-05-28 23:47:35

This isn't a critique of the content. The app and company are dissapointing to me. I've paid for an add free experience but for some reason they think it's okay to pepper podcasts with adds. It makes me feel betrayed. I'll be jumping ship the moment I find a better option. Re: the reply I just got... I'm not sure what you misunderstood about my post. I paid for an add free experience.

Problem is that it doesn't work on the chromebook. All you can do to fix this is by uninstalling it everytime you want to listen by this method.

"I use Spotify for podcasts. The filtering in the episode list isn't working correctly. I usually choose to display only unfinished episodes. However, if I stop an episode and choose another one, the one I'm partway though doesn't show up in the unfinished list. If I haven't finished listening to it, it should still show up to play it later.",3,2025-05-28 19:46:49

"Used to be good but it seems like they are just greedy now, free version is buggy and annoying and paid is definitely not worth the money since it barely works let alone as advertised. I will not pour money into something I don't enjoy for free, the way they try to make you purchase premium absolutely ruins the app, it's just so annoying. get a different music service.",1,2025-05-28 14:01:38

Well I really love this but if there were slightly less adds I'd love it. kids and adults both use this app and kids usually don't have the money to pay and the adds are disturbing. but it's a really good app altogether I can find all the songs i want and I really love this app. wouldn't be able to live without it,4,2025-05-28 10:55:57
Why is it that when you're watching a podcast and you want to skip an ad all of the sudden it swipes right and plays a completely different podcast and there's no way to get back to what you were doing? is that a feature or a greedy annoying error?,3,2025-05-28 10:55:35
Loved this app until a few days ago after the new update ruined your ability to track your podcasts you haven't finished in one place & removed other features making the whole podcast listening experience terrible. Now I'm trying to switch to a new podcast in the car on a long drive & I can't even find anything without pulling over to focus on the phone when I use to be able to do it in a couple clicks. Now it makes zero sense & it's impossible to track forgotten half listened episodes.,1,2025-05-28 10:54:36

again and again asking for membership,1,2025-05-28 10:19:56
"Very frustrated that Spotofy removed the ""New Episodes"" tab for podcasts. My one star rating will remain until this is changed back. In response to Spotify's reply: You made it way worse.

"Spotify Premium has been good to me, but as a heavy user of its Podcasts functionality, it's gone downhill the past few weeks. * The New Episodes auto-list is gone, replaced by a ""Podcasts > Following"" that inexplicably shows me episodes to which I've already listened, and doesn't show me recent stuff that I still haven't finished. * The Google Home integration now suffers from ""stutters,"" where the podcast will backtrack the audio by 2-3 seconds, as if a kid is playing with the rewind button.",3,2025-05-28 09:41:08

"The new podcast functionality is complete garbage. Even if it wasn't glitchy as hell, it doesn't list only the episodes you haven't listened to yet. It lists every published episode going back at least a week, maybe more. So if you follow a lot of podcasts, you have to sift every randomly listed podcast episode, including the ones you've already listened to, to find the ones you haven't heard yet. It was a terrible, useless idea. And it's even more infuriating because the app was already glitchy",1,2025-05-28 09:23:54

I followed the support instructions, but it's still the same. Update: As it turns out, this all has to do with Google Play managing your account as a third party. Fix = cancel your subscription in Google Play and WAIT FOR THE PREMIUM BENEFITS TO EXPIRE, before restarting your subscription within the spotify app. 👎👎👎 💩",1,2025-05-28 07:22:59

The best app for listening to music that I have had in my life! Edit(05/27/2025): I recommend that at the moment you download music and also download the lyrics because is a little uncomfortable to be Offline and if you want to read the lyrics have to change to online.

"good app, like the format. WAY too many ads. ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" and even now I wasnt even 10 minutes in and 5 ads. so either spend $15 a month for no ads, or get ads interrupting my uninterrupted 30 minutes and cutting off songs. also, spotify is always trying to change my music with things like ""New Music Friday"" which I dont mind because I'm not interacting with it but then it incorporates ""radio based off what's in my playlist"" into my music and it's extremely annoying.",3,2025-05-28 06:02:48

"Almost after every song you listen to, there's gotta be at least 2 or more ads. I normally don't care about having to hear ads, but having to have an ad that is spends at least 75% of your time on Spotify is hosntly ridiculous. If you want to spend money on premium for the ads to stop, it's just for a short amount of time. And if your not on Spotify, it'll still count as time for it.

"The shuffle feature is absolute garbage. You'll turn on shuffle, start with a new song, and then it'll queue up the same songs you've already heard before. Then, when you restart it with a new song and what should be a *new* shuffle queue, it'll go back to the same exact song queue from the previous shuffle. I shouldn't need to use external apps to shuffle a queue of songs I'm paying to listen to.",1,2025-05-28 05:42:26
I love Spotify however I opened up to Spotify one day and it changed my playlist so that it's just shuffled and I can't choose which song to play and they only list the songs. I don't know if this makes sense but I've been trying to fix it.,3,2025-05-28 05:42:26

"it shocks me how bad UX designers are at their job, moving the latest podcasts list away from my library, where each episode is concise and i can see a good 4 or 5 at a time as i scroll down, to the home page where each one is a large card that is more logo that info and i can only see 1 and half as i scroll, is infinitely a worse user experience. where before i could easily flick between downloaded and new lists, it is now on the other side of the app, which is a pain.",1,2025-05-28 00:46:26

the free version is completely unusable due to the constant ads and the algorithm playing everything but your playlist. on top of that the paid version just keeps getting more expensive and will just remove music with no warning,1,2025-05-28 00:44:22

"Spotify has become absolutely unbearable lately. It promises a 30-minute ad-free listening session after a short ad, but guess what? Just two minutes in, boom—another ad. It's incredibly frustrating and feels like false advertising.On top of that, there are WAY too many ads overall. You can't even skip more than six songs in an hour, which makes it nearly impossible to enjoy your own playlist the way you want. It’s like the app is forcing you to pay for Premium by making the free version.",1,2025-05-28 00:16:36

"I love Spotify because it lets me listen to music for free. On Chromebook, it even lets me go back on free version. But why is it 2 stars? Everytime I close it, it doesn't let me reopen it, and I have to delete it and then reinstall it EVERY SINGLE TIME I WANT TO USE IT!!! Edit: I looked at the other reviews and turns out that this is a common issue for Chromebooks. Unless you are willing to reinstall it over and over, don't use Chromebook. Either way, this is the best music streaming app.",2,2025-05-28 00:13:19
"Every time I say I don't want to hear an ad or the ad keeps playing back to back, it continues to play those ads over and over even if I select that I'm getting them too much. I was shown an ad 14 times and every time i would dislike the ad and select a different reason why but i still got that ad so I uninstalled and used youtube music instead. horrible app.",1,2025-05-28 00:12:42

I prefer this app the most over the others. It has the biggest library as far as I know and the magic shuffle helps you find new songs. But the downside is that most features are locked behind premium. It would be better if there are more features for non-premium members.,3,2025-05-28 00:06:13

"While the app is great, I wish they allowed you to use gift cards. If you have a premium family account, they will not let you use a gift card. I found that out after I purchased the gift card. Also, they only give you 15 hours of audio books per month. I go through that pretty quickly as I have a lengthy commute. You can purchase more hours but that ends up being the cost of the audiobook from audible.",3,2025-05-27 23:30:59

The issue can be fixed by checking if the app needs to be updated, but it still might not really fix anything. The app does still help me get through tough times, and SOMETIMES the music recommendations are OK.

I pay for Spotify premium so I don't have to listen to the ads. Recently the app has started prompting me to access my Bluetooth which I intentionally have turned off. I looked for a help or feedback option under settings to let them know it is annoying and they don't even have an option to give them feedback. My main complaint about the app is that the search options are very minimal and there isn't a good way to browse for new podcasts. Spotify is better at recommending music than podcasts.,2,2025-05-27 21:35:48

Why the Podcast Episode change? The New Episodes was perfect for podcast listening. Now you just have to sort your library into Podcasts but it doesn't show the specific episode just the title podcast. Not a fan of this change at all.,2,2025-05-27 20:25:11

Spotify is a great app and I would 100% recommend IF you can afford premium.The no-premium experience is not great hence 3 star rating. I had Spotify for a couple years and when I first got Spotify I it wasnt necessary to get premium.I would only get a single ad about every 30 mins. this eventually got worse and it's as if the adverts started stacking.I then had 2 adverts every 30 mins. Now Im at a point where I get 3 adverts IN A ROW every 3 songs. Premium is too expensive might switch platform,3,2025-05-27 20:09:29

"Removing the ""New Episodes"" section has ruined spotify for me. 90% of my usage is for podcasts, and it is now harder to identify new episodes I want to listen to. It used to work perfectly, and now it doesn't work at all. Goodbye spotify",1,2025-05-27 19:57:34
"No way to remove songs you don't like from your history. Not enough control over your music preferences. The apps ""memory"" of your tastes seems to be limited to your most recent listens. Difficult to discover new music. Playlists consist of only the most popular songs from an artist, with little variety and ignoring the other tracks on an album. This further feeds into their algorithm, so it slowly dissolves into the same tracks over and over. EQ is also bad and doesn't do what you'd expect.",2,2025-05-27 19:55:34

"They no longer show ""New Episodes"" for podcasts. You have to individually look up each podcast to find the new stuff. So stupid. Why would I subscribe to the podcast if you won't show me the new stuff easily??? Edit: No, you didn't put it anywhere. You added a dumb AI thing that no one wants and got rid of an easy way to check new episodes. There's no creator connection section or whatever the hell you said.

This is disgusting, and I tried to report it or press uninterested, but i don't see such a button to do either of those things.",1,2025-05-27 08:23:22

"horrible excuse for a 'music' app when most of it is ads being blasted in your ears. the mobile interface has been so horribly watered down and ruined now. they removed the queue, and all of your songs play on shuffle. it SUCKS.",1,2025-05-27 07:20:49

it doesn't have the option to search or find music by hearing like YouTube music does. when I am passing by anywhere and I hear any sticky music that I do not know of. I use to open YouTube music to know the music song.,4,2025-05-27 07:02:15

I love Spotify you can listen to your favorite artists on here and make your own Playlists and add all your liked songs into 1 Playlist the Adds aren't annoying and constantly poping up you can leave the app and still have music playing in the background as you open another app its so great to have Spotify,5,2025-05-27 06:55:20

"O Spotify é simplesmente sensacional! A interface é super amigável, e a qualidade de som é impecável. Amo as playlists personalizadas, como o Discover Weekly, que sempre traz músicas novas que combinam com meu gosto. A possibilidade de baixar faixas para ouvir offline e a integração com vários dispositivos são pontos altos. É o melhor app para quem ama música e podcasts, não vivo sem! Recomendo demais!",5,2025-05-27 06:40:40
"I think spotify is a 5/5, considering with ytm you cant turn your phone off to save battery without a sub. although I do dislike the fact you can't just select a song without it doing something random without a sub, I feel as if they should just take a idea from ytm where you can just play the song but with 1or2 adds. but other than that it's a great app 👍.",5,2025-05-27 06:35:55

Now–since a few days ago, It is extremely buggy which is not acceptable for such a big music streaming brand with large user base. Among of the issues spotted is playlist no longer able to play full song, songs playing according to its ecosystem rather than those selected by me. Unsure [no notification] if its a 'force to premium' for such a hefty price for 320kbps while T*D*L gives me up to 9K for +-/ similar price.",1,2025-05-27 02:10:56

"Spotify already decreased in quality when they changed their algorithm for music; I used to discover new music or older deep cuts on their ""artist/song radio"" based on what I'd listened to. Now that function basically mixes up songs I've already put on other playlists regardless of genre or mood. The recent update to podcasts is infuriating, too. Episodes I've already listened to remain in the queue, cluttering up my feed. Episodes that have no appeal aren't able to be removed, either. Why?",2,2025-05-27 00:53:23

"The ""free"" version is terrible, why can I only play 6 songs while being forced to listen to ads? Why can't I use the queue, why can't I play a playlist in any order without paying for a useless premium that will still give me ads. This is a greedy company and make your free version 70% of the app I will consider using this again. I forgot you also charged my brother for your ""free"" trials.",1,2025-05-26 23:53:31

I'm tired of the constant nagging to review the app. You get 1 star. Are you happy now? I've been using Spotify Premium since 2012 and been happy with it for the most part but starting to look at other options. And I don't enjoy the fact that prices increased and Joe Rogan gets paid hundreds of millions of dollars. I don't care about podcasts and don't want to pay for it. Is it too much to ask to pay a reasonable amount of money for a good music service and leave it at that?,1,2025-05-26 23:43:28

The new update which added the + button in right bottom corner is absolutely annoying.

Why do you force us to play the music we love idont want spotify premium if you don't. I'm gonna give this app 1 star,1,2025-05-26 13:27:42
most of the time when I'm listening to my playlist it just goes to a random song halfway and when I'm finding a song sometimes it also goes to another suggested song.,2,2025-05-26 13:26:58
"Rating 1 star because I'm angry at the way Spotify does audiobooks. Not enough listening time for even one book! No warning when you are about to run out either, book just stops mid word. We should get to finish the chapter. This design is deliberately cutting books off without warning to manipulate us into buying more hours. $15.99AUD for 10 more hours. Audible cost $14.94AUD for full unlimited access to a whole book regardless of how long it is. Who is paying for more hours at that price??",1,2025-05-26 13:26:23
The last update may 24th 2025 is really bad. the new futures do not work and in order to view new episodes as before I need to manually go to each podcast. please do not be like google and don't kill a good thing. thank you. the new fees is not good.

I just want to give my 2 cents on the create button added to the bottom menu... It's a little redundant since you can access that from the library section. It also isn't as necessary as the other buttons. How often will someone make a new playlist? Even new lists based on a currently playing song can be access with a long press... It's kind of annoying. Sorry.,5,2025-05-26 12:04:32

"Lots of trash that won't go away on this app. Like rap caviar and other globalist pop culture nonsense on the top of my recommended. Also when I down vote an artist or song in a genre I like it continues to play the artist and song. I had significant bugs last month and there was no way to report them or fix them. Some bands I likes albums are unavailable. Lastly, as a musician I've heard spotify completely hoses over the artist. Very sad. also doesn't have a lot of songs I'm looking for.",1,2025-05-26 06:06:18

"Edit: Figured out I can fix the shuffler by never favoriting music. Now they've gone and ""updated"" the queue for music and it sucks. Literally a de-evolution in user interface. Why would you swipe one song at a time? Just go back to the check system and let me delete a bunch of songs at once with a dozen clicks. On top of it being bad interface, it also is super buggy. I get graphical glitches that fill my queue with red trash lines, the queue also breaks all the time. Just change it back.",1,2025-05-26 05:37:14

On phones you have to pay premium to be able to go back to another song or have a specified Playlist and I just think that's dumb especially because with other devices there isn't a problem like this At first I thought my phone was the problem just to find out that everyone had this problem. And I have to deal with this every day that I'm trying to listen to music in. like I'm just trying to relax but no because Spotify decided I will like this song more. Just let me listen to my Playlist,1,2025-05-26 01:26:53

I have been using Spotify for more than past 7 years. And the experience was relatively gud at start...but day to day their changing policies is making it so hard to continue using this app. It's very disappointing they are continuously changing policies just so people buy their premium plans. It's like leaving them no option but to delete it. Please every listener has their own priority to where they want to spend money. I don't think i can countinue using this app.,1,2025-05-25 20:15:21

"New update is trash. All the functionality of Spotify is now gone. What a waste. **Update** to podcasts as of May 2025 is awful. No longer have the ""new"" tab for podcasts. Completely useless now. I wish I could give this app a 0/5",1,2025-05-25 19:48:07
I always play my music for background noise around 30% volume. Sometimes when the song changes the volume shots up to 100%. I was hoping this could be fixed but it's been a year and this has become more frequent like every next song it does this. It is so annoying because it breaks my focus since it needs attention to lower down the volume once again. Don't you have testers for this kind of stuff? A whole year of terrible experience for me.,1,2025-05-25 19:47:32

"my frustration with spotify grows. the user experience should occur in beta before making it widespread. why on earth would the average user want a create button where the library button was. what. now, they're making finding your new podcast episodes harder by ""conveniently"" making it hidden in a side section of the home page. I can no longer navigate to new podcast episodes when driving. stop moving things.",1,2025-05-25 19:14:06
to much ads,1,2025-05-25 19:13:16
without premium spotify is not best if you want spotify you must get premium,1,2025-05-25 19:11:41
just drop the subscription price bro my wife took all my money and left so im broke 🙏🙏🙏🙏💔,1,2025-05-25 19:07:47
"4 stars because some basic features are unavailable due to not having a premium subscription, which is ridiculous. Otherwise, this is a great music-streaming platform!",4,2025-05-25 19:06:21
very nice app 👍,5,2025-05-25 19:04:35
the addition of this AI DJ is so off putting. I'm going back to soul seek.,1,2025-05-25 19:04:16
there’s better alternatives. EDIT: why did you take away our apk? that's the only way we can use the app normally. it's so sad how this wonderful app turns into scammy and greedy app. you're just like capcut bro,1,2025-05-25 19:03:09
It's nici and great but somethings are annoying.,4,2025-05-25 19:02:40
first of all removing 'new episodes' for podcasts who ever came up with thay idea should be fired. App I use all day everyday because of the content but very bad app alot of bugs stops working and crashes for the amount premium costs its unacceptable,3,2025-05-25 19:00:26
excellent,5,2025-05-25 19:00:00
"Spotify has started its true colour,users can't listen to their music,users can't listen to their favorite part ,can't use it for the day,so what is the use of it,only shows to explore premium",1,2025-05-25 18:59:02
Awesome 👍,5,2025-05-25 18:52:01
Greatest listening music,5,2025-05-25 18:51:14
"Spotify is amazing but the mobile app is actually abysmal. Without premium on other platforms, all you get is ads. On mobile, you can only shuffle play lists, get 6 skips an hour and an enormous amount of ads. Being able to skip songs as much as you want, queue songs, play any song you want and listen to stuff in order should NOT be locked behind a paywall",2,2025-05-25 18:50:17
it is really good for listening to songs,4,2025-05-25 18:47:40
you spam the free 3 month ad to me but the one time i want to claim it apparently i cant,1,2025-05-25 18:47:34

"Where is my list of New Episodes of podcasts? The only feature I use and you've taken it away. It goes in Library. Put it back. Now I'm opening my Apple device, finding the latest eps there, and then searching them on my Spotify phone app. Ridiculous!!!",1,2025-05-25 18:42:55

"alr, overall is good but the problem is my algorithms not match with my song, I play jazz or pop music, after one music, it plays worship song, what's wrong? I don't even always hear worship songs",1,2025-05-25 18:35:48
"I like spotify it is my favorite app for either listening songs or podcast . l really wants to thank tha creater or developer spotify , for making my listening of song super easy and interesting A very very thank to you .",5,2025-05-25 18:34:07
it's been great,5,2025-05-25 18:32:36
"Good music, okay app except way way way too many ads for no reason. Spotify is too money hungry so they give us so many ads, every 3 or 2 songs I get ads. On laptop I get less ads and also get to play songs in order but on phone its a horror, I'm rather listen to Spotify on laptop.",3,2025-05-25 18:32:19
😒,4,2025-05-25 18:31:58
In the latest updated version it is getting very difficult to like and unlike a particular song if it is running. Earlier there used to be a heart ❤ emoji to like or unlike simply. Why u r making it complicated. Now I have to go to liked song playlist then from there I have to remove it. And there is no option to listen similiar song if a particular song i am listening. Your Other competitive platforms are providing it. How will u compete with them? Be simple and innovative.,3,2025-05-25 18:31:15

bagus banget aplikasinya cuma disuruh premium mulu,4,2025-05-25 16:41:31
"Spotify in my opinion is best even without premium. I know ads are a bit annoying but for free you can at least compromise with 5 or 10 second ad. There are a lot of features that i can't describe like making a list, listening to a particular artist, organising your list on your own accounts, lyrics, podcasts and what not .",5,2025-05-25 16:40:44
