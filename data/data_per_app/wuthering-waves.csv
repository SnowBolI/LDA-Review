"Do NOT rush your game do NOT overly relied on players input and do NOT continue to take refs on other game. At some point you will have to create something that is new that players will want to continue playing, because right now the gameplay boilsdown to pressing left click till you accidentally parried and switch character.

"As much as I enjoy Wawa, there's one glaring problem. The writing of some amount of the female playable cast.

And here's how, they just tweak the files in unreal engine file(or something, I don't really know much) to remove or reduce the visual quality ingame to increase performance like removing/reducing grass and fog. Surely, this might help us mid&low end players but we're concerned as it technically(probably) violates the ToS.

I know you guys are trying to cater for mobile but the experience on mobile is horrendous unless u running with a higher end phone this is why wuthering waves should be on console I used to have a similar experience on genshin. terrible gameplay on my phone made me play the game less but now it's on xbox I literally play it everyday and I'm not comparing I love wuwa too just don't feel as motivated to play coz of the experience I just really hope kuro send it to xbox soon,2,2025-06-17 03:09:00

The game is amazing but its very unoptimised for even high end mobile devices. Characters look amazing but they all NEED their sig to perform. Team building has become more restrictive and the lack of new 4* variations is just bad.

"Wuthering Waves enters the genre not as a contender, but as a hollow derivative. Its core is a tedious labyrinth of mechanics designed to exploit player engagement rather than reward it. While the 2.0 update applies a thin veneer of improvement, it fails to fix a fundamentally broken engine.

At first I really like the game, the storyline, art style, mechanic and characters. but this game doesn't release any male character since then and no 4 star so ever. game become more and more easy to play but they messed up the storyline. yes we need more rewards but also the feeling of achieving something while playing. like drive into the game world for a moment.",2,2025-06-15 21:20:44

I critique the outfit choices though, men's clothing seems to have more decency than women because too much skin is exposed.

Please fix the bug where the character's faces are showing no expressions during quests and skill cutscenes. it's really annoying because the expressions make doing quests alot more fun. Hope the dev team quickly fixes this issue and until then I'll just stop doing quests,5,2025-06-13 19:32:01

"everything in this is game is great, I can say it is better than most mobile game that I known especially for Open World RPG, I really like it, but it just need more optimization to reduce lagging, well I known that is not easy for this great 3d game, but I hope the game can be more playable for my low performance phone.",5,2025-06-13 04:37:39

"It's by far the best action rpg I've ever played. Engaging story, elegant mechanics and a simple hero and gear optimization. You spend more time playing and little time having to tweak this or that. No ridiculously complicated crafting and no worries about inventory management. You can tell it was made with care keeping both casual and hardcore gamers in mind.

I was really excited for Wuthering waves as I'm also a PGR player but unfortunately I am not able to play the game because of the constant crases occuring I have mentioned the problem 1.

to think I'm actually revising my review for this game is not something I thought I was going to do but here we are. while their recent Livestream was decent it felt more like they're the ones celebrating and not all of us because how can you pull out a 10 rerun system with the same 50/50 system while giving an amount that's barely enough to guarantee one five star? it feels like a slap to every one who was there from day one so I'm keeping my rating low for now. hope you bounce back kuro.,5,2025-06-12 15:45:14

"In general, the game is nice and beautiful, but there are extreme optimization problems. My phone runs Genshin Impact without any problems, but there are extreme lags and freezes in this game, especially in the new version It started to lag and freeze more, and the gamepad support is not very good. I hope the development team will handle the optimization problem better and make it work in the middle segment.

I LOVE this game. The graphics are exceptional and the cutscenes are divine! I never get bored playing this game because there is so much to do! The only problem I have in this game is whenever I disable tracking a quest it would return back to my screen as a tracked quest and I have to disable it again. I don't know if this is intentional but if it isn't I do hope that the developers can fix it.,4,2025-06-12 07:07:30
"Amazing game available on smartphone. I can't believe I am playing such a nice game on a platform like a smartphone. I really recommend you people to give this game a try, you will not be disappointed. If you ask me, the game has amazing graphics, incredible characters, an actually interesting combat system, a well thought out game progression loop and beautiful songs with plenty of animations. The only problem is the story as the NPCs are too trusting and loving to a stranger (us). Unrealistic.",5,2025-06-12 07:06:26

i really love this game but the problem with the next update is that the storage in my opinion is a bit too much and it's kind of unfair to those who also plays another game that needs alot of storage but have little to no storage left (unless your phone has alot of storage) so i really wished they lowered it to at least below 10gb,3,2025-06-12 05:50:37

i love the game but the storage is the killer for mobile phone users. 52gb for the latest patch alone is overkill for a gacha game. i know it wont be final 52gb after but still it would take up 20-30gb.

My phone battery drains faster and becomes hot, but the game loads fully and doesn't lag",5,2025-06-11 17:53:33
please optimize the game for mobile it has tons of lags and crashes and fps drops. Can we have something for the space too? i feel like the space every patch is getting heavier and heavier and most mobile users won't be able to play and will be forced to upgrade their storages or phones for more spaces.,4,2025-06-11 17:31:41

"i liked the game and it's story but i hope kuro fix the lag issue for low-end device users, and i hope Kuro add the feature of removing the used mb on the past quests just like on genshin impact so that our device can keep on the updates of the game.

"4th review: Wuthering Waves never disappoints apart from the anniversary patch in 2.3. In Patch 2.2, there are more refined combat flow and Echo responsiveness, making fights feel smoother and more rewarding. Patch 2.3 brought amazing anniversary events, generous rewards, and standout new characters like Zani and Ciaccona. Visuals remain stunning, and QoL updates like better navigation make exploration even better.",5,2025-06-11 14:01:20

"The Anniversary update didn't feel like an anniversary and was so far the most boring update of the entire game. Event bloat with a lot of boring events and giving barely any more rewards than a normal patch, while having all characters rerun during it. The story is normally rly good, but their events are weak.",2,2025-06-11 11:30:42
"3rd review: With all the fixes and optimizations by Kuro games, the game has reached its peak. The story has been amazing so far and the combat is still one of their best selling point. I see no powercreep as of this version, and most of the characters are well-written. Although the anniversary patch is a bit boring, I'd still rate this game a 10/10 due to its recent versions and optimizations.",5,2025-06-11 11:25:42
What's happening to my account I just played recently but the moment I open my game again today my whole account is gone. I can't even retrieve it but that account is linked to my email.

"I really enjoy playing this game. I heard of it by chance and started playing this month. The storyline is interesting, and the characters are unique, with both personality and fighting, making me actually want to get them. The banners are pretty generous, and the game is good for F2P players like myself, and you can get materials easily.

"The game design is good, but should get ray tracing for the console version. But that aside, it's over-hyped for what it is. It feels like it was specifically to satisfy pay to win players. (commonly seen in combat events). Defense still exists as a stat too. The character designs are good I guess, but they've recently just become unoriginal. Inspiration is fine, but overdoing it gets to a point where there're no original concepts and no original ideas.",4,2025-06-08 20:41:38

"ANYONE CAN LOSE PATIENCE after tuning 40+ echoes only to get mostly DEF or HP substats. I really like the game‚Äîespecially the rewards and combat system‚Äîwhich is what keeps me playing. However, this part of the game mechanic is what I hate the most. There‚Äôs no guarantee, even after tuning 100+ echoes, which are already hard and time-consuming to farm, especially when aiming for specific substats. On top of that, collecting echo EXP also takes a significant amount of time.",3,2025-06-08 06:43:48
"Let's be honest in a lot of ways, this game is just genshin. BUT imo this is far better than genshin. The combat is far superior, the exploration and puzzles are far more interesting. The farming doesn't feel as tedious, and the company seems to ACTUALLY care which is great. They don't just want your money. Hopefully, they continue to be a great company and hopefully, the voice acting will be improved, and some of the more grindy bits are made more lenient and they add more co-op stuff!",5,2025-06-08 05:45:39

Extremely laggy and has fps issues. I wish to play this game but the game does not let me due to its really high demanding specifications for both phone and PC that makes you just go play some other games. If the devs choose to optimize a little more for mid and low end devices then it will get a lot better. Putting a minimum ram rating of 4GB is diabolical when its half the time you are facing crashes. Just increase the requirements on here or optimize some things for lower devices.

However, I am rather disappointed in the lack of free rewards as of late, Kuro is very generous overall, but in comparison to beginning of the game, it's lacking.

The bad ""OPTIMIZATION"" on my Xperia 5 iii. Every 30 mins, the game will force close even im using the phone in room with cold temperature. But still, it's crashing and unable to open again and i haaaddd to restart my phone and everything normal again until it's crash againüóø.

Update: I gotta say that the 2.0 update is amazing. Everything is masterfully done and just smooth as hell with great new characters and a good story. Flight is by far the best reason to play this and I hope they make this available for all regions. The 1 year anni was disappointing and the rewards lacking. Devs are still stingy as hell. I really hope they up their game and give more rewards as a lot of clone games are coming out and not many people will stay when others offer new things.,3,2025-06-05 03:45:57

"Story: the opening game is slow paced and the story is not that engaging. World: the game is big and visually great to look at, the sacrifice is that I don't have a connection with any of the places and NPC's In the world. MC: Rover had a personality but now feels like a cool empty self insert devoid of personal characteristics. Supporting cast: The 4 star United's don't have enough screen time and don't feel good to play. Highlight: The Encore Quest had amazing voice acting.",1,2025-06-05 01:06:22

"My initial rating would've been 4/5 due to great gameplay and characters, with downsides being echos and 50/50 system. However, I am extremely disappointed with the upcoming anniversary. Cramping 10 rerun banners (with 50/50 btw) together with popular limited characters while not even providing enough pulls to get any 5-star, not even a limited char? I'm angry at how they phrase this as ""player-friendly"" when this is the most predatory anniversary yet. It's not that hard to give good rewards...",4,2025-06-04 20:53:20

Bosses are fun to fight well some, while they are difficult especially in the later part of the game aka holograms the satisfaction i felt as ive beaten difficulty 6 is immense. Gacha system is solid especially the weapon banner with a guranteed pity system. Generous devs that listens. Story had a slow start but it gets super good later on. Ps.

I have it on my phone and tablet (controler compatible). My phone does overheat when I play for longer periods of time, but it could also be my phones problem (I have a ZFlip 5). Even though it does overheat, I love to play this game. Theres plenty to do with all the events and quests, so youll rarely ever be bored. Definitely download if you can!",5,2025-06-04 14:00:25
"Wuthering Waves is fantastic! The combat is fast, fluid, and super satisfying and I love the characters each of them has a unique personality. The world is stunning and great for exploration.

"Good game but sucks optimization. Idk why when in package download it's just randomly got an internet error even if it's consistently downloading at 10mbps. It's annoying because it's a big file package download, I'm waiting for an hour just to see the download just stopped so it was a waste of waiting. Fix it bro because it's a big file package.

Hot mess this became from an early favorite... minimum balance when battles matter most between dodging NOT dodging and being held in place with zero functionality for absolutely no reason and bosses spawning randomly away when within range of battle area sometimes taking no damage then suddenly battle ends like you win or lose. Gotcha system has become poor when pulling new characters and can't earn anymore radiant tide. Did 2 10x pulls when I didn't even click on it. That was a loss...,1,2025-06-03 23:47:26

"I really enjoy the combat in this game and the storytelling and visuals have gotten a lot better. However, there are many issues that still haven't been addressed at all, such as: -lack of male characters or usable 4 star characters. 1 male character a year is not enough. -not many good free weapons, pressuring you to pull for limited weapons. -terrible echo substat rng. They could've fixed this with a reroll item but they instead made a main stat modifier, which doesn't help with substats.",1,2025-06-03 06:18:27

I've been playing this game ever since 1.1 and I have to say that they've been improving a lot! But there's a few issues that I'll have to address. This game really needs a lot of optimizations and graphic improvements especially on low end devices. Frame drops and blurry visuals are really common issues that mobile user's encounter often. I've also been experiencing intense lag pretty often everytime I enter a battle field. But other then that this game is a masterpiece.,5,2025-06-02 17:27:10

BUT their preview for Anniversary was a total mess due to (some) players outraged that their wasn't going to be a free 5-star Character, due to LEAKS.

Aside from all that, this game has been a breath of fresh air. Hope to see more from Wuthering Waves.",4,2025-05-31 05:26:13
All issues have been solved by the developers. One of if not the best game developers I have ever seen. Not only do they provide tons of ways to farm asterites but also very f2p friendly. Much better in most of the aspects in comparison to it's competitor.,5,2025-05-31 03:26:43

Coop mode is annoying. Achievements for coop forces ppl to create at least 2 accounts to get rewards. weekly boss has 3 entries/week. So for 1 character you need 4 weeks. Its the key reason to skip some limited banners. Annoying farm of materials. Too limited endgame content. The last dreaming deep event is a repeatable disaster.,2,2025-05-31 02:13:21

"I've enjoyed the story, but as a person who pays attention to detail such as character designs and..

The performance, I have a good and working gaming laptop, it runs good with 3A games but when it comes to WUWA it starts lagging in areas with a lot of things in it and when boss fights starts using a whole lot of skills.

"the 1st anniversary is not that good ,but it's way better than the genshin impact anniversary before ,and The game is not well Optimized in Mobile ,the devs must prioritize the optimization for mobile devices than the PC, I suggested to lower the resolution and such base on their Processors or chipset like genshin devs did before in their game. which is way more smoother gameplay now than before.",2,2025-05-28 09:54:35

"The game is OK but very sweaty, if you're looking for a casual free to play friendly game this isn't for you. People will invest hundreds of hours into building and playing a 4 star character and tell you you're bad if you can't clear end game content the same way.

"It came so far but with the direction they're going, they're really starting to isolate their older playerbase especially with the direction they're going for character designs. Story is great but they're really going full-throttle pandering to a specific audience and it's just not worth it anymore. You seriously can't open with a male resonator and have this male-female ratio right now. Cantarella was robbed of her elegance and upcoming characters will be too. No class.",2,2025-05-27 19:21:06
"Started off great with balanced character representation and amazing gameplay. I was genuinely excited about where Wuthering Waves was headed. But now it‚Äôs clear the game is shifting into the usual waifu-first gacha formula. Back-to-back female banners, sidelined male characters, and female kits tailored to be good and unique. Feels like the early balance was just a marketing tactic. A bit disappointing for players who were hoping for lasting variety and fair representation.",1,2025-05-27 19:12:52

It's an open world with a variety of characters. What makes it special is the engaging scenes unlike hoyoverse style of gameplay. You can interact with animals which is cuuuute!,5,2025-05-26 21:28:52

"It's the one of the best game I had played in a while , everything here including gacha , action, exploration, rewards and other permanent rewards are quite compelling. Besides good things there are certain things that needs improvement - 1) I think damage cap and each max substate roll increment. After playing genshin for so long , I am quite compelled by big numbers. 2) Enhancing memory optimization feature. Rest of the things are just fine in the game . Thanks for reading it <3.",5,2025-05-26 19:52:58

"Been playing since release and I'm done, you guys should've announce that no more male resonators are going to be released on future patches so some hopeful players like me would move on, it was bearable at first but it's getting annoying. It's just too immersion breaking to play, and I've seen the upcoming region's teaser and although it looks cool, I know who's symbols are those and all of them are female, I'm just done waiting kuro, most didn't have the same treatment like Jiyan.",1,2025-05-26 19:17:16

"Honestly, big improvement. The game is no longer laggy or has many bugs. The only problem i have is the lack of male characters, i'm bored seeing female characters even though they're pretty.

I will say though I am losing interest though as a player since launch. The story unfortunately took a turn for the worse after Mt. Firmament and Jinhsi's chapters. It went from apocalyptic, intense and theater like gaming, to a severe nose dive into harem and romance territory.

new genre in gacha games and I'm loving it all,5,2025-05-25 00:30:31
The game is really good however after the 1.1 update the game crashes every 5 min and I'm not able to play even though I was looking forward to the improvements made after 1.0. The screen sensitivity is also incredible high and the game lags much more than the previous patch,5,2025-05-25 00:09:32

"I play this game before around launch month but not day 1 player. I got a lot of laggy issue and clunky movement. The combat is amazing its make me remember HI3. I can't judge the story/lore cuz I'm not interested in it. What I can say is, Its not click with me, the VA seem a bit emotionless at that time. I stop playing cuz it felt like a chore and I don't like that. A game should never feel like that, it should make u enjoy or at very least still fun to play. That's my experience/review.",2,2025-05-24 23:30:24
MAKE YOUR OPTIMISATION GOOD FOR MID DEVICES,4,2025-05-24 23:11:27
"To be honest, the reward from wuwa is really good, from the anniversary, birthday, even the weapon banner is guaranteed, which I didn't notice before. But the puzzle sometimes just doesn't have a clue, and we leave hanging, put indicators or light to show where to go which will help a lot. Sometimes the stage is just too hard, like in vigil in endless night, that thing is just too soft to defend it and annoying to do some mission",5,2025-05-24 23:05:09

"Runs fine on my tablet but intolerable amount of stuttering and frame lag on my PC. The character & world aesthetics + the quality of the game music fall short compared to Genshin, but it offers a refreshing alternative in the gacha gaming arena. The combat mechanics of this game alone make this game worth checking out, not to mention that the devs appear highly responsive, unlike Genshin. However, this game is in desperate need of performance optimization, for its open world and combat alike.",5,2025-05-24 21:47:02
playing this game on mobile hurts üò´ butt it's still wuwa I highly recommend this game if you like the game genshin but wishes are cheaper pitty is 80 and artifacts farmers rejoice you can farm all day long üòÄ hope genshin gets better ngl but this game slowly becoming my favorite gotcha,5,2025-05-24 21:00:08

"the game is slowly turning towards pay to win, be it the recent Anniversary reveals which only people who pay can enjoy(12 banners is player friendly? seriously?) or be it the new DoT system which makes it so that the newest and fan favourite character NEEDS another Gacha Character, basically turning into if you want more dps from X you need Y character. or be it the fact that it's almost been a year since game launched and there's only been 2 4* released and both are trash.",1,2025-05-24 20:16:40
"Mid game, decent enough to kill some time with until better games come out. Not worth spending money on. managed to build a solid reputation with 2.0, then proceeded to absolutely ruin it with the shady and predatory Anniversary Event, killed all hype for this game's and studio's future. Absolutely horrendously unoptimized on mobile, the story is dogshit, telling more than showing, animations look cheap, ugly and weightless for a high budget game, characters designs, personalities are so bland.",1,2025-05-24 19:34:35
good,5,2025-05-24 19:20:30
"Honestly this is a great gatcha game, there is room for improvement but knowing the devs we will continue to get more QOL and mechanics changes. The combat especially amazing in this game. Quick swaps, Swap cancels and advanced mechanics like these allow you to get a higher skill ceiling which is great imo. The more skill you develop this game rewards you for that since the overall dps increases if you do these mechanics right. Story is amazing too",5,2025-05-24 19:03:03

"I have been playing this game since it was launched. There are so many bugs and issues but I respected Kuro and the devs team that acknowledged the problems and fixed it even though it took some time. Start from version 1.3, the story and contents have many improvements at its peak from version 2.0 onward. I really appreciate all the rewards and contents that they have prepared for the anniversary but it would be great if the devs understand what most of their players want. Overall great games.",5,2025-05-24 18:52:18

"I played this game fofr the first time and it was incredible, it has incredible fighting styles, but i think devs need to optimize this game more since it's only 1 years old, it is laggy, make the terrain more low graphics like the grass is moving when passed by even in lowest setting.

Plus, I do not see the necessity to put Lore that is delivered in the most lazy way possible. Better make a separate story about that, instead of putting a png and text without any voice acting. 2.3 Version was really bad, and it should have been the Anniversary version.

Great game for a gacha game. Has frequent updates that focus on more then just adding new characters. Is fairly free to play friendly (again for a gacha). If you liked games like Genshin Impact but got tired of the stagnation that game had then this could be a good contender for your next favorite gacha game. 4 stars because it's a gacha and still has predatory monetization.,4,2025-05-23 17:45:10

"Wuthering Waves is visually stunning, with amazing character designs and smooth gameplay. But after returning, I felt emotionally detached. The lore feels too shallow, and while companion stories help a little, they aren‚Äôt enough.

2.0 - 2.2 was amazing 5/5 changing my review from 5 to 3 with how the anniversary patch felt. timegated event with missable rewards if you don'tsign in on time. mediocre amount of currency/pulls for the number of banners. And the worst variation so far of the previously most fun event.,3,2025-05-23 07:53:36

"I love this game, and it has so many interesting maps, mechanics, and characters! But the performance is a MAJOR PROBLEM! It forces itself to close each time I try to play, and my phone has 256gb of space, so it's not a storage problem. I tried to adjust my RAM as much as I could but it didn't work. Other than the trash gameplay on mobile on the LOWEST settings for graphics, the game is good and has potential! A few tweaks might be needed though. I had the game since release too-",3,2025-05-23 06:33:56

"how is it for other games an anniversary means ""alot of free stuff"" and ""a character to play more"" yet wuwa gave nothing but events (work) and 10 summons,the summoning system in this game is unfair anyways so unless you want to spend $200+ a character and weapon dont play this game,love the story and the characters but its like wuwa dont want me to enjoy the game without paying heavily, i get its a gatcha game but other gatchas arent this greedy with the characters or stingy with the rewards",1,2025-05-23 03:30:15

banyak karakter baru tapi gak bisa gacha. tiap gacha butuh 65+ pulls dibanner senjata dan karakter. trus kalo mau DPS bagus mesti punya sub DPS. jadi tiap patch kira2 harus habisin 390 pulls. beneran game gak cocok buat spender kecil ato f2p. rate gacha ampas. gak percaya nonton aja YT.,1,2025-05-21 18:13:29

"this is the worst update the game has had by far. not only is the game absolutely empty of event content to do, the ""anniversary events"" are (some) time gated, lackluster in rewards and ONLY 1 out of the 19 """"EVENTS"""" has any actual gameplay to do. 3 hours of content for a 45 day update is simply pathetic and the (also heavily time gated) web events do not make it any better. I'll update my rating in the future if appropriate, but I've never felt more inclined to quit this game entirely.",1,2025-05-21 15:07:09

"I have been playing since day 1 and the game that Wuwa was then and what it is now is unreal. They fully transformed and improved that random game into something worth experiencing. The only thing I would like to criticize is the story. While the story got MILES better, the way they handled Cartethyia's sacrifice felt cheap. They should have just let her die in order to leave a bigger impact. I hope they'll follow PGR's story route and not be afraid to be brutal to their characters...",5,2025-05-21 13:04:57

"On my device, Genshin Impact runs smoothly at 40-50 FPS, yet Wuthering Waves struggles at a frustrating 12-14 FPS, even on the lowest settings. This huge disparity is unacceptable.

I really love this game. out of many other free world type of games this is THE best. Everything from story to characters to game play is literally THE best. but I have only one query. can you increase the amount of members in one team? like 3 in one team is good but it would be more convenient if it's 4 instead of 3. Just a request because if it becomes 4 then it would be more fun to play as I can use another one of my 5 star character,5,2025-05-19 21:53:53

You forced me to download this game on mobile. so many anniversary rewards are locked behind web event and that webpage is neither opening on PS5 nor you have a separate webpage on mobile or app for those events.

"The story is alright, gacha system is fine but the base game, graphics look pretty bad and the optimisation is terrible, tested on multiple low-high end phones.

"I love everything about the game, the gameplay, the rewards. but my problem is that Kuro is slowly leaning into a weird group and designing female characters just to appease them instead of prioritizing the game itself, it makes female characters simp for the main character and make them wear less clothes for men, please don't be like Honkai impact 3rd and I hope it improves in the next region! :3",5,2025-05-17 09:25:10

"The devs are absolutely clueless about how to run events. The current one is time locked -- essentially, a large subset of people are either asleep or at work, and they have to watch the event go by and not be able to participate at all.

"A lot of potential, the big problem is that it is increasingly laggy. At times barely anything loads and you get kicked out constantly. The wifi is good one second and becomes 999 in a blink of an eye. People are impatient and want everything to be quick. So I recommend trying to make a setting for mobile users with low fps or just making something to drop ping. You don't need to change much. But, don't always take my word for it. I am very inexperienced with these types of things. Good day!",3,2025-05-17 02:28:28

"Dear wuwa devs Please stop sexualizing characters, I'm sure you are aware that there are still young players, Please don't forget that there are players under 18, don't be like Genshin, I wanted to play wuwa before but has been disappointed so far about the character designs, so far the story, gameplay, animations are So good for me but the characters are just not it, it's even embarrassing to play wuwa outside of my comfort zone because of the characters and the exaggerated physics's. thx. üíï",3,2025-05-15 15:23:48

As they got enough players now for the anniversary they didn't even give a free 5 star unit .. all they gave us is more events to spend more time grinding those 10 pulls and astrides. They don't have a pity system like genshin. at starting I lost back to back 4 50/50s and won 1, now lost 3 50/50s in a row if I lose my next 50/50 I'm done with this game..",1,2025-05-15 12:12:14

Thank you kuro for this wonderful game that respects f2p players. I have been playing your game for a while and the only problem I noticed is that I have a really good phone which could even play Fortnite and ark ultimate edition easily but I am getting lags in wuwa in low settings. it happens after like 30 minutes of playing. please find and fix this issue kuro. everything exept the optimisation of the game is perfect. I would have rated it 5 stars if it wasn't for the optimisation problem.,4,2025-05-15 11:36:20
"Wuthering Waves is absolutely incredible! I‚Äôm completely hooked. The design and graphics are stunning‚Äîevery environment feels alive and beautifully crafted.

"Wuwa is a game that had a very rocky start. The start of the game still suffers from that however I have come back for three reasons. Carlotta, Phoebe and Lupa. The gameplay still feels like a mix between Hi3 and GI tho that's not a bad thing. However I do prefer ZZZ's style of parry as this one can be a little temperamental for me. The login rewards per patch are a mix of premium and standard summons. Flying in the new area is great, but they've yet to make it work elsewhere. Play on PC/PS. ani",3,2025-05-15 07:40:01

I have played this game since release on a few different devices ranging in power and Wuthering Waves feels like a mess in terms of what it's going to run on and what it is going to lag on. My device capable of running modern games with massive open worlds can handle anything but not WuWa. I tried to contact support and I was left with empty promises which were reinstated during the anniversary Livestream just for changes to be minimal.

"Im a returning player of WuWa, even tho i was dissapointed at the recent character Cantarella because of her design being a bit too much and inapropriate.

Now, im thinking of just dropping the game.",2,2025-05-13 19:58:30
"Pros: >Love the art!!! The Devs are generous as well. > Beautiful and unique character designs üíì Cons: > The story is a bit generic > The animation is quite crusty and impact frames goes randomly, almost all characters have IF so it doesn't really feel special or impactful compared to other games. > Toxic fandom, they think they're better than genshin fandom but they're the same, the only difference is that the player base is not as big as Genshin's but the same toxicity. > Lots of gooners.",2,2025-05-13 19:12:01

The game will go down the same direction as Honkai Star Rail with how the anniversary rewards are. Punishing Gray Raven was extremely generous with their 5th anniversary to celebrate their players and it's owned by Kuro Games. The anniversary of Wuthering Waves seems like a premium filler patch sprinkled with extra rewards. the rewards are rather lackluster when you think about how they are gonna release 12 character banners in 2.3.

Day 1 player here Story: Story IMO has become so telegraphed with the foreshadowing too in your face and gets repeated throughout the story. The pacing is decent and the plot is interesting but still needs a bit of subtlety. Gameplay: Wuwa always had great game play but has recently become stale. I don't even bother parrying in most cases because of the endgame modes being time clear based challenge. Fractal vice is fun and I hope for more skill based gameplay rather than number crunching.,3,2025-05-10 22:21:54

I'm not saying all but most in general there's some game company industry that genuinely cares about the player experience let's take Valve Company for example it's been yrs has already passed yet L4D still active till now. that aside it still lacks of male characters hoping u Kuro have already planned that out dont let us down",5,2025-05-10 05:56:42

"This does not even deserve a one star. All your disgusting fan service is the reason you're falling off, do you not see it? If your story writing is really that good, the fan service wouldn't be needed. This only tells me that even you don't believe in your own skills in story writing, so you had to sexualize everything living and breathing. Such a disappointment, I really had high hopes. Do better as human beings.",1,2025-05-10 05:03:41

"The game is really good. The only problem i have is the rate. Guaranteed weapons are cool but winning 50/50 on char banners? I always have to go the last pity to actually get the char. When i was playing genshin, the char and weapon banners are bad BUT there's always chance to win the featured 5 stars in like a first 10 pull if not the 50/50. Some of my characters there even the archons are obtained that way. Here, always had to go all out. It's also hard to 100% huanglong than rinascita.",4,2025-05-10 02:22:31

The quests are great, the gameplay is awesome, the npc's look amazing, graphics are alright (but only for tablets/computers), and the characters are really cool. The characters are definitely fanserviced, but it can't be stopped, lol. I rate 4 stars because there are honestly way too many female characters, and I'm pretty sure everyone wants new male character/s. Overall, though, I think it's a really fun game.",4,2025-05-09 13:52:55

The reason why I changed my review from 5 to 3 stars is because currently, the lack of Male characters you push out compared to the female characters is quite disappointing.

"Probably the best gacha up to date tho the ""details"" is too excessive especially the Canterella issue that detail was too much tbh, its unnecessary and a bad look for the game since its arleady good as a game and doesnt really need excessive fan service, people can just go to chrome if they wanna goon.

"Whatever you guys did with Rinascita. Keep that up and surpass it. Rinascita is the very first moment in a gacha game where I never thought it's a gacha game but a typical AAA non-gacha JRPG in most aspects from the music to the narrative and the writing. What a humongous step-up from 1.0 and 1.x patches are already good. However, don't be afraid to explore darker and mature narratives. Needs more improvement on the writing as well. it's too cliche and predictable. TOO MUCH FANSERVICE.",4,2025-05-09 04:46:41

"I'm surprised that the mechanism of the game is far different from most Gacha games. I completely love how the game did. all different styles, all different powers and battle mechanisms. The reason I switch to this game is because of how the developers are so talented and hardworking. They also give out generous rewards far better than others. Not just that, the game also concerns players about health. And that's very rare. This game is far better than HOYO. Thank you, Wuwa DEV.",5,2025-05-08 14:58:05

"The game boasts excellent storytelling, brought to life through stunning, high-quality cutscenes. Single-player performance is buttery smooth on flagship devices with 12 GB RAM. In contrast, co-op mode suffers from noticeable stutters and intermittent bugs/glitches.

"Imagine review bombing a game because you're too cheap to want to support it, not even a little bit and expect all the freebies because you were spoiled in the past by Kuro, grow up, get your money up not your funny up. Or maybe you review bombed it bc of ""predatory"" gacha practices for the anniversary banner when OFC THEY WANT TO MAKE MONEY but they're still much more forgiving than any game hoyo released The game has so much QoL in it and it's beautiful.",5,2025-05-04 15:58:08
"I played mainly on Ps5. But, I think Wuwa has a lot of potential and is growing very rapidly in terms of fanbase and quality. Plus, the devs do listen to people, sometimes strict, but overall, not the worse. The game itself is very generous, and as a person who has 100 hours in both Wuwa and Genshin, I find Wuwa easier to get 5 stars and far more generous. But I may be biased. As I only played Genshin because of friends, while Wuwa, I love playing even when alone.",5,2025-05-04 15:56:05

As a female player who played the game from the start, I have lost hope of them treating us equally. A reminder for anyone feel like raising suggestion or reporting bug, just say you are male player. They will listen to you IF you are MALE. Be harsh on them, they will serve you just the way you like <3.",1,2025-05-04 10:46:44

"The anniversary felt underwhelming‚Äî12 banners but only 1 guaranteed 5* in the first phase? It should‚Äôve given at least 2 or a free 5*. Events like Returning Rovers feel pointless; who actually has inactive friends returning? The ""pull X times"" event just rewards spenders, not F2Ps. Also, the lack of 4*s makes it even less F2P-friendly. Overall, it felt more like a cash grab than a celebration.

I would love for the characters in dialogue to be more animated, like how it was when Chixia and yangyang first met Abby, it would make the game feel more alive.",3,2025-05-03 10:05:44

For instance, someone losing control of their powers is called overclocking, but the theme of the game is sound.

"I'm really sorry wuwa but the anniversary event finally got to me, the event barely had male characters in them (I'm a male player btw who prefer big boba) but really this sucked cause where's the balance? shouldn't you also cater for your female fan base? I'm really disappointed with the lack of male characters and interactions with them cause look at Jiyan and all the other male character design. The female fan base had expectations, but nah you just threw them away under the rug. sadly üëé",1,2025-05-01 21:51:19

"Love the game, the gameplay, and almost everything about it. It's just disappointing that the direction of character diversity is predictable. Thus far, significantly less males are being released along with an increasing highlight in female sexualization. I hope that what you have advertised at the game release would have been followed, but alas, the game is slowly but surely leaning in THAT direction. Hope you take these character suggestions well as it kind of demotivates some. Kudos!",3,2025-04-30 22:11:17
Anniversary content and rewards are lackluster. not sure if Kuro or Tencent is behind being so stingy with players who saved this game. 2.3 DOESN'T EVENT HAVE A MAP UPDATE. Barely any male characters. 24 limited banners in 2.3 part 1 and 2 with NO guarantee to get the character. No free character or skin for anniversary. Not even a repeat of Xiangli Yao from last year for the PLAYSTATION community who missed out. Projection of the Somnoire Anchor from past event but it's not even a weapon? Weak.,1,2025-04-30 22:09:52

"Updating my review after having a poor experience with the anniversary. I used to like this game but Kuro disappointed me so much. I'll wait to see Cartethyia's story in 2.4 and if that's not satisfying either, I'm totally deleting this game.",2,2025-04-30 03:29:22

"2.3... The anniversary. Oh boy, QoL are pretty good ofc, the events are let's be honest not really fun? The cubes are cute but C'mon... Zani? oh man I need Phoebe... what pissed me off the most? that free 10 pull and banner thing dangling in your face and says ""wait for 23 days"" after Zani's banner including Phoebe's. It could arguably say that there's a lot of rewards but stretched to an unbearable time frame. I'm not one of those players ""WHERE'S MY FREE ZANI!?"" but I'm incredibly disappointed",2,2025-04-30 03:08:02

"This game is an absolute gem‚Äîeverything feels spot-on, and I‚Äôm confident it‚Äôs only going to evolve for the better. I‚Äôm not here to nitpick or suggest changes because, honestly, it already nails the experience. However, there‚Äôs one issue that really needs fixing: the official Discord server.

"Good game that has great graphics and gameplay. The 1st Anniversary is just bad. Some rewards are time gated but they still show up on the event page (if I cannot claim it now why show the rewards to me). There are 10 rerun banners to let you pick a previous character without any enhancements to the drop rate, so you better hope you with the 50\50.",1,2025-04-30 01:34:50
Optimisation has improved a little bit . The gameplay is fine but I would suggest a bit more creativity with the events. Edit: 2.0 exceeded well beyond my expectations Edit2: 2.2 story was pretty good Edit : The version 2.3 feels very lackluster overall and a lot of issues are not being addressed properly in the game.,3,2025-04-30 01:31:27

"Increasingly predatory monetization scheme, subpar anniversary rewards. Gameplay is fun, characters have diverse kits, good graphics. But in the 1 year I've played Kuro has become more stingy with free giveaways. New characters being released have kits built around being paired with other paid characters to incentivize even larger buy-in. Prices are predatory. It costs $80-160 to pull a single character. $80 to pull associated weapon. I can't condone the game or industry with these practices.",2,2025-04-30 01:24:33
"Outstanding! Great and different combat mechanics, awesome movement system, great rewards, intreaguing storyline. There's no way I'm returning to Genshin after experiencing this game! Just keep working on phone optimisations! Please! Epic!",5,2025-04-30 01:21:38

"My device is mid yet it's fine at medium settings - a huge win for me. Had played since release, all the improvements are very noticeable; while most could say it should've released this way, I get why they focused on refining the basics... how they possibly could. The combat is still strongest suit of Kuro Games, graphics coming in second. I don't regret my spent time here at all, despite the doomposting - try for yourself and find what appeals to you. Don't listen to others.",5,2025-04-29 23:54:53

great game but my device is not that good so mostly I lag in the good cutscenes and something I lag while in battle and all my settings are currently on the lowest but I still give it a 10/10 great game love the characters the attack effects are crazy good in my opinion this game is better than genshin impact sorry for all the genshin lovers but this is my opinion,5,2025-04-29 23:26:22
is this game have a bug or what. I could have sworn that last time I got standard character 5 star in the rate up banner. now I tried to pull for zani and why do I get another standard character. are you really kidding. this is different from what your banner said.,1,2025-04-29 23:21:29
bad anniversary rewards,5,2025-04-29 23:21:11
"BEWARE: Zani sucks. Forced co-op event in single-player game. Bad development team puts in a new character that needs items that cannot even be collected yet! And stop using the Rover as the Main Character, the Rover sucks.",1,2025-04-29 23:19:50

the game is very good. I was going to give it 5 stars but the problem is that whenever I open the game it starts compiling shaders. it started happening after this update. so i kindly request to developers to fix this issue. it takes 5 to 10 mins to compile.,4,2025-04-29 16:42:51

actually I would have given this a 5 star rating for the game experience. I really found this very interesting and fun to play but the major problem I am currently going through is storage.

"A gacha game where the devs actually listens to what players want and is very generous when it comes to rewarding their players. Fun gameplay and very beautiful scenery in the game, but the devs should tone down with the fan service.

This game is one of the best games I've played of it's genre. Literally has EVERYTHING you want and need without realising. Combat is perfect Aesthetics also Adventure and so on can keep rambling but basically it's 10/10 The best part is that the Devs are CONSTANTLY LISTENING TO US! now the juicy bad bits.... Slyly laggy at times on mobile. edit: gave it 3stars instead of 5stars because the ratio of female to male characters is just too much and I think they're tryna sexualise women for profit,3,2025-04-29 16:02:45

Love this game. It's just a bit laggy sometimes. It's really good but there's always a lack of echo upgrade materials.. not to mention the fact that Echoes rely on rolling to get a substat.. if that fails then you end up using more mats.. which we always lack.. please add a mode where we can get a lot of these and not just rely on events that give these out..,5,2025-04-29 11:27:48
"This game is amazing, counter parry a enemy in the game at the right moment feels satisfying but will take time to master. and dodging is really cool. Exploring the the open is truly amazing. Even though playing this on mobile can be hard sometimes because am using a Sg S10+ which is understandable, it functions well, but not so well when playing in co-op because of my phones loading time :( but am glad that WUWA is now on Ps5 which I'll be upgrading pretty soon. Thank you Kuro",5,2025-04-29 11:24:23

Don't let the fact that it's a Gacha game or the review bombing fool you. This game is not only incredibly polished but there is a lot of love and care that went into this title. From the very detailed and honestly at times very beautiful character models to the rich and very lively environment that is just filled with lighting effects and overlays really bring out the best of this title. if you have more capable hardware do it. But for a mobile game it is absolutely breathtaking.,5,2025-04-29 04:21:43
"the game's size on mobile is quite large compared to most other games, I would like to suggest some solutions that might improve the experience: Compressing game data Giving players who have already completed the missions the option to clear their data for completed or inactive missions, which helps reduce the overall size without affecting their progress.

"I'm leaving a bad review as someone who has been a huge Kuro supporter and got my friends into it. I'm leaving a bad review because it feels like I have to. From the bad anniversary roll out with the company heavily favoring new and returning players as well as hedging out any F2P players with their lack of 4 stars, creeping glitches and the pervasive feeling of semi-betrayal. I love the story, the gameplay feel and the graphics as well as characters and their designs‚Äîbut can't recommend rn.",2,2025-04-28 13:36:57

"The game would have been perfect like a fresh white linen but the stain? The story. We wake up memoryless, thrown into jargon with zero buildup. Characters orbit the protagonist like satellites, and the constant ""Rover glazing"" makes it feel more like an Otome game. Every area follows the same tired loop: Sentinels cause problems, clingy characters, and vague promises that memories fix everything. Villains feel like mosquitoes‚Äîeasy to squash and easy to forget. This world deserves better story",3,2025-04-26 23:00:30

"runs like hell, even on lowest graphics.",2,2025-04-26 22:07:54
I played the new companion quests. the stories themselves weren't too bad. but the amount of times the characters get touchy feely and flirty with Rover is CRINGE worthy. it's not bad on its own. but it feels forced. I've had enough of that. the MC feels insincere because of all those interactions. and the characters themselves feel like a copy of each other. i can't find myself getting attached to any of these characters. besides that. everything else about the game is perfect,2,2025-04-26 21:55:25

"I love this game so much! I don't know why people are so greedy like can y'all get a life?? they are working so hard to make all the greedy players satisfied, all of you should be ashamed. Kuro shouldn't have to listen to some greedy players especially the people who are ungrateful, I guess this is what happens if you listen to people, being nice to them, and giving everything they want.

"With how allergic the Devs and certian loud players are of male characters, as well as how all the female characters just fall head over heels for the MC at first sight, it's basically just gathering wives at this point.

"The game is fundamentally a ripoff of other titles in its genre with no creativity whatsoever. Aside from fast paced gameplay, it offers absolutely nothing. The story isnt well thought out even after a complete rework, which is straight up laughable. Dialogues are poorly written and characters dont even try to act real. Font choice is bad, walking and sprinting animations feel clunky, and the UI is awful. It caters to hardcore fans rather than casual players who draw the most.",1,2025-04-25 22:45:22

I'm really upset that the game doesn't work with some android devices.. I played during launch but stopped because of the lag once the second update came out I wasn't able to play on my phone anymore I got this chromebook but I can't even get past the loading screen without it telling me to return to a physical device,2,2025-04-25 14:32:08

"One of the best games out there, the storyline is awesome leaving you wanting for more, you can literally feel like you're playing as the main character (Rover) instead of just being a passive mc that is no better than an npc who goes around getting beaten up, and the gameplay mechanics is top tier. This is my favorite game now. I'd like to say more but I'm not really that good with english so I'll just end my review here, peace.",5,2025-04-25 14:01:31

"My camera becomes unstable whenever I fight the turtle weekly boss. Lock on does nothing. This issue makes the boss 2x harder to fight because I literally can't see anything (the camera would clip inside of the turtle). There's also a texture problem on Android in the Avinoleum map (for the waterways specifically). When you're riding a gondola, the waterways would literary disappear (revealing the map below), or changes to a floor-like texture, swallowing the gondola whole.

"If you liked Genshin, you'll love Wuwa. The company listens and prioritizes players before money though (huge difference vs Hoyo) The gameplay and mechanics are different - there's, parry, counterattack, perfect dodging...The animation and story cutscenes are SO GOOD, it doesn't feel like we're staring at game models/npcs just lip syncing and doing the same hand motion. It feels real, the characters feel alive, and THE STORY IS SO GOOD. There's also a skip button with summaries.",5,2025-04-25 12:07:39

"Wuthering Waves is a visually stunning and ambitious game with a lot of potential, especially in its world-building and character design. The combat system feels fluid and engaging, offering a refreshing take compared to other gacha-style action RPGs. However, there are still areas that need improvement ‚Äî such as optimization, UI polish, and deeper storytelling elements to fully immerse players. With consistent updates and attention to player feedback, this game could easily become a top game",5,2025-04-25 11:04:14

"While I still play other, similar, games in the open-world Gacha space, WuWa has quickly become one of my favorite games overall. Exploration is fun, the Banner system particularly with weapons guaranteed is a massive boon to players, various update events have all been a blast, I could go on. If I could make one complaint, it would be for the lack of *viable* 4-star units. Otherwise all issues I've had personally have been addressed over time by a developer that puts the work in.",5,2025-04-25 05:18:25
"I like the game, the amazing playstyle, and the world building, but I wish there was a character who is actually a character villain who actually hates the main character. I hate that whenever a villain is said to be like really mean, it ends up just being another person who likes or is obsessed with the main character. In other words, I want the mc to feel challenged at least once instead of being this all power full mc who defeats every boss without a sweat.",4,2025-04-25 05:06:16

This game is VERY similar to genshin, but I hope it changes, i hope this issue gets solved soon, I have deleted it temporarily untill it gets solved, I only went through the gates at the first story quest and the crashes got worse.

probably the best gacha game I played. It's truly worth it seeing the game rise up to fame as I am a 1.0 player. The faith I've put here hasn't disappointed me. Not to mention how generous they are when it comes to rewards. 10/10 story 10/10 gameplay but the game can always do better. Keep up the great work Kuro!,5,2025-04-24 21:57:00

"I‚Äôve played Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail, but Wuthering Waves is the best gacha game I‚Äôve tried. The combat is smooth and fun, and the world feels alive. What really blew me away is the 2.2 story it‚Äôs emotional, well-written, and super engaging. I didn‚Äôt expect to get this hooked, but now I can‚Äôt stop playing. If you enjoy gacha games with great gameplay and story, definitely give this one a shot.

I love this game. Character kits have some depth to them which I enjoy thoroughly. The story is pretty good if you care to listen to it (particularly Jinhsi's/Jue's). Plenty of combat events that give a really good amount of currency towards pulls. There are some more laid back events as well if that is more your taste.,5,2025-04-24 17:19:21

Came back after watching the anniversary stream. Loved to see the devs approach on the anniversary. Totally in for the celebration. I hope devs always continue to love the game and continue making improvements. I liked the celebratory mood rather than the usual gacha games money making approach. I think new features will really feel rewarding. I don't care much about rewards because devs really make us feel that we are celebrating the anniversary. I hope that you continue like this.,5,2025-04-24 17:08:49

"I see a lot of people are flaming Kuro for not being generous with Aniversary rewards, which is understandable and I agree 100% banner is needed. However, for a mobile game it is still decent. If you want a bad example of mobile game with crazy greed, it would be Raid Shadow legends. PTW and they would nerf characters after patches so all that money spent was for naught.",5,2025-04-24 05:45:45

I love the gameplay and the environment of the game. The only problem is the ping and lag. I would like to see reruns of events for those who are new to the game or for the casual players. Like the Zani event or the Xiangli Yao event back in 1.2 or something similar. That would be nice.,4,2025-04-24 03:04:16
Hello! Greetings to Kuro Games. I would like to thank you for creating Wuthering Waves and let me experience different kinds of adventures. I like to know more about the Sentinels because they are interesting. And please add more mechanics about parrying and dodging enemy attacks as well as some unique sounds during parry and dodge like we can actually feel the weight of the attack by just hearing the attack or dodge sounds. Or if possible can we create a base or buy a house in every region? Ty,5,2025-04-24 03:02:35

"It's a good open world exploration game with an engaging story and a challenging but fair endgame. All in all, more enjoyable than Genshin, with very thoughtful map design, exploration streamlining, and of course fairer content for casual players. Took out three stars for the censorship issue because it's really upsetting to see the devs make changes to characters some players paid for. Otherwise, the game is a solid 9/10 apart from a few minor QoL hindrances. PS: disappointing anniversary",3,2025-04-24 00:42:30

"Anniversaries are supposed to be the time when developers show their appreciation to players for supporting their game. Kuro decided that creating 2 anniversary banners of 12 characters with STANDARD 50/50 mechanics and 30 immediately usable limited pulls (farming events and exploring a map is patch content not anniversary rewards) was more than enough to reward us. I should have expected that in the end every million dollar company is cut from the same cloth, with the exact same goal: Money!",1,2025-04-23 23:27:47
"Amazing game, I would say it's an improved version of genshin. The combat mechanics are far better. Button mashing like in genshin does not work here.

"The improvements to optimization and the multiplayer experience has been really solid so far, but with the recent announced changes for the anniversary patch, 2.3, it feels as though Kuro games are undervaluing long-term players and putting up very exploitative banners while giving little in the way of rewards for an anniversary. As a player since day 1, I feel I should get the priority, not new players who came in late. Also, ignore people complaining about fanservice and male characters.",3,2025-04-23 22:56:08

I don't meam to do attack on hoto game but let me remind you guys a lot of hoyo games have almost no improvement.

"Meager rewards, predatory practices, FOMO and endless grinding. This game does not respect your time as a player and tries to get away with doing the bare minimum improvements necessary. You can get some enjoyment out of it in the beginning, but after a while it devolves into 5 minutes of dailies (chores) every day while you wait for something to change.

"Amazing, fun and engaging combat animations and really beautiful scenery, the reason I'm rating this a 1 star is because of how high the specs requirements are...you need a 12GB RAM phone in minimum to even run the game properly, my current phone (One Plus 7T) cannot run WuWa almost at all because of the extreme overheating it's like this game might just explode my phone, while it can run other big games like Genshin impact and Honkai: Star rail perfectly fine with 0 lagging and overheating.",1,2025-04-23 16:51:29
"Hey Kuro! just wanna say that the freaking performance of the game is back to the previous version that had passed. Too much fps drop and glitches, even if I switch to the lowest graphics as possible, It doesn't make any difference. Right now I'm not in the mood to play this game!",1,2025-04-23 16:48:32
Nice,5,2025-04-23 16:45:59
"wanted to start with some cons. This game is too heavy to be a mobile game, it really requires a high end mobile device to actually play this smoothly, the lagginess is too unbearable as it hindered a great gameplay experience (and so i moved to pc). That said, great graphics and mechanics, really different from others and unique, but also very detailed, it's so eye catching although not an eye candy type. Overall amazing game, but needs far adjustment for the mobile experience to be playable.",5,2025-04-23 16:43:08

Hi Im Khyver I would like to give a message to kuro games. Kuro You have been Great and generous to us players Dont get offended by those Ungrateful players who want more pulls You have given us enough and im very thankful for that kuro you have made the game that changed my life thank you I hope you done more good things in the future thank you,5,2025-04-23 14:14:20
game is good but i m not happy with the female characters because they are more hotter then me and my bf plays this game so i feel jealous thats why i don't like this game don't make the female revealing,2,2025-04-23 14:11:17
I'm giving 5 star because kuro deserve it. kuro don't listen to greedy individual on the anniversary rewards. the generosity you showed all this year is already wayy to much then a so called gacha game called genshin. You guys rock it. Be yourself and bring the creative things you guys bring always. thank you guys for hearing us. but I'd say anniversary is kinda cheap from the patch apologies we got from you guys as a day 1 player. but hey I'm not complaining.,5,2025-04-23 14:06:03

"People do be hitting that 1 star because of the so called ""worse"" anniversary rewards, like dude, even if you are a day 1 player or not, kuro is still generous with you and it's not their fault that you're having a ""you"" problems with the rewards. Other than that, if you still insist on wanting kuro to up their rewards, i think it's time for you to go to other games my guy or look at yourself into the mirror and think what you can do when you're in the position of this situation.",5,2025-04-23 13:50:56

"Been playing since release but i had my fair share of not playing the game for a few weeks and months but overall the game us great and a fun, my only issue is that the more the game updates the more connection problem. The game used to have 1-90ms which is considered as Green ping but lately after Black shores were added the game always stayed at 100-200ms which is the Yellow ping, it's annoying to fight a enemy especially when the ping drops during a attempt.",4,2025-04-23 13:38:16
"Kuro is generous right from the start. Every patch the event rewards are decent. Free astrites, pulls & many more. I dunno why people are too greedy and requesting for everything to be free. This game is beautiful & amazing.",5,2025-04-23 13:33:24

"great game, disgusting greedy fandom. in 11 months i never enjoyed a game this much. it was so giving and caring for its players, so only real players know how the devs love their game and their rovers. the ones causing the chaos are just some kids with no sense of enjoying the game and be thankful. great work kuro, please keep up!",5,2025-04-23 12:45:33

"Really great game tbh, specifically the combat system and the fact that 4 star characters are designed to work well with 5 star characters, the MC is also really well made and not useless compared to other gacha games. One thing you guys might need to improve is the performance you get playing the game on a middle end phone and below, everything else is just chef's kiss.",5,2025-04-23 11:47:01

"I had high hopes for this game. And I genuinely believe it's a bit better than genshin. But lately, it seems Kuro games have been taking notes from Hoyoverse. I'll admit, I'm not pleased with the anniversary awards. And what is it with the lack of not only four star characters but also male characters? The last guy we had was Brant, and even then, the hype for him has died off. Any hopes I had for this game are flying out the window if something doesn't change for the better.",1,2025-04-23 11:02:29
"I love this game. It's amazing actually. The combat, story, and music, is all top notch. The world building is sublime. So why 1 star? Their recent anniversary stream shows exceptional predatory behavior, an underwhelming and disappointing update and rewards, stupid cubes, and that the devs are generally out of touch with the community. Offering free limited 5* with 1.2 but anniversary 2.3 just has rerun banners with the same pity system and 50/50 as normal. Like, thanks kuro?",1,2025-04-23 10:55:50
This game is fun to play and I love the mechanics on this game like how all the characters are able to run up the wall and evade the obstacle while doing so. All the characters in the game is just eye-catching. I also love how the combat system works in this game. This game also generous for giving me free 2 5-star characters at the beginning of the game. Thanks for free 5 stars. Cheers,5,2025-04-23 10:44:34
"I love the graphics, it doesn't load in a very slow and painful way and the developers are very generous. However, some designs are pretty much too jiggly? but I don't pay much attention to that although the people that are complaining are. the open world adventures are very very fun but the developers should listen to the players complaining about the extra physics in the game. nonetheless, very nice game, I love it.",5,2025-04-23 10:43:15

Wuwa ran smoothly on balanced settings before, but after the new update, it lags badly and overheats, even on low settings. I want to enjoy the game‚Äôs beauty, but now I can‚Äôt even play properly. Kuro Games, please optimize it for low-end devices, or sadly, I‚Äôll have to quit‚Äîa game I really don‚Äôt want to leave.",3,2025-04-23 02:47:51
"this game is phenomenal! the visuals, graphic C's, storyline, and the characters are really good. I don't get why other wuwa players raging just because of the 2.3 in my opinion, it was really a great deal for the players. don't say that the event sucks cause it's not. people are believing fast because of the leaks that were half meant true. I just expect the players to be more open-minded, I feel bad for the devs and the whole staff. GOOD JOB, WUWA!",5,2025-04-23 02:32:48

"Wuthering Waves is awesome and full of potential. parries and dodges, use animation canceling, and build team synergy. Focus on your main DPS and farm echoes smartly. Explore thoroughly for rewards, do dailies, and upgrade wisely. For top visuals, max settings . Hopefully, they‚Äôll add ray tracing on mobile devices for even better graphics!",5,2025-04-23 02:19:35

"Putting this here in case the review bombing comes over to the playstore, personally I think they're being childish about the Anni rewards, how much better could it get? I was gonna skip the patch bc I wasn't wanting anyone, until I heard Brant was rerunning alongside many other limited 5*, it's a miracle for those both F2P and just joining the game. At this point, it's the complainers who are the problem, Y'all devs did the best you could with how little you have.",5,2025-04-23 01:44:06

"I'd like to say it's a great game with amazing main story and character designs along with the landscapes itself but just one small thing I wish would be possible for the exploration world quests I wish it wouldn't block off co-op or I wish you could do it in co-op if you needed help for example vigiless night or whatever it was called is pretty hard, like I'm sure character builds or leveling could help with that but it's just a struggle, otherwise I think its a great game",3,2025-04-23 00:52:06
"Absolutely love the game, the only game where I actually started spending",5,2025-04-23 00:30:35
"The astroturfing here is crazy Comparison to the worse mainstream gacha rewards to WuWa is just pathetic. I am also disappointed with the rewards but it doesn't invalidate the hard work of the devs and their timely response to feedback. I will understand disappointment but being worse is just a disingenuous take. Hoyoshill wants this game to be the same rating as genshin, wow.",5,2025-04-23 00:19:39
"This game has no idea what it wants to be. One moment it‚Äôs a post-apocalyptic/ dystopian sci-fi game, the next it‚Äôs just another generic fantasy game. It feels like the devs just ripped off whatever was popular at the time and just hoped it would work. Heck, even the rewards are inconsistent as well, players get free 5-stars during a random filler patch, then get completely snubbed during the anniversary patch.",1,2025-04-23 00:15:56

"The obvious things aside, exploration in the game is very simple and relaxing. The game will have many tools that guide and handhold you from one treasure chest to another. But also because of that, you don't feel like you're exploring or on an adventure. The map is big, but fools you with few and not so engaging gameplay. If you are casual, you will appreciate that it's like a guided tour in an amusement park. But otherwise, exploration is not that fun and quite hollow. Not for me",1,2025-04-22 21:14:54

"Graphics, voice acting, character design, story and combat mechanics is just absolutely amazing. I honestly don't think there is another open world cross platform RPG that can top this. I will admit that combat in this game can be quite challenging but not too difficult to the point you want to throw your phone out of a window (based on experience from other games lol). It also almost feels like I'm playing a souls-like game due to how punishing some of the enemies are in the game.",5,2025-04-22 04:43:35

"it's an extremely fun game personally, when I just roam around the game I enjoy the sceneries and how organic and visually pleasing the game is, I sometimes forget that WuWa is a Gacha game and end up playing for hours on end just to enjoy the world. though it's sad to see the most of the voices in the community doesn't appreciate this, criticism born from Abnormally high expectations berate the game and it's dev team and false information further fanning the fire Time to set the foot down",5,2025-04-22 02:50:16

so far the best game I have ever played. there are no domains to farm for strong artifacts when you can use the enemies as your artifacts. gameplay is smooth and amazing and each character has their own unique flair,5,2025-04-22 02:33:08

"Great combat system and from 2.0 nice story telling and voice acting. But devs (or Tencent which aquired the majority of shares from Kuro games) are showing their greediness with the Anniversary patch where they put 12 banners all with 50/50 and giving almost the same number of free pulls as the other normal patches... very disappointed, I was expecting a Ciaccona for free or a 100 pulls extra for free so we could use them on whatever banner we wanted and they would've still made money...",1,2025-04-22 02:10:11
"Wuwa‚Äôs really fun and the bestest for me. Farming astrites, echoes, and other stuffs is easy for me‚Äînot sure for the others, lol. Though, there are some parts where it is challenging, but tutorials helps me and i‚Äôve soon find the quest easy! There are just some times where my iPad(12.9, m2) lags, especially at some characters‚Äô bursts like changli, but that‚Äôs alright. Not really a big problem for me. Also, i love how they reply fast, hours or 1-3 days, to my concerns(email). Great game!",5,2025-04-22 01:56:27

"The best open world game I have played. The gameplay, designs, and lore is pretty good devs are very generous and listens to it's players and works hard for the improvement of the game. coming from 1.0 player I fell in love with this game because of its uniqueness like being post apocalypse themed and the mysterious lore behind who really is the rover and I can't wait to know who really that goddess we met in the beginning of the story.",5,2025-04-22 00:39:15

No free five-star, not even a standard unit. Just 30 pulls and a glider? Seriously? What makes it worse is that Kuro gave us Xiangli Yao for free in version 1.4, but not even a free five-star for the actual anniversary? That‚Äôs just backwards. How does that make any sense?

I'm not blaming you but your fanbase :"")",1,2025-04-21 23:55:32
"it's really just like genshin only with a huge makeover and woth a sort of survival futuristic theme instead of an adventure fantasy vibe. really awesome for those of us not wanting the too easy or annoying lost drops when you open chests and beat monsters. the only major downside to this game really is that it keeps crashing when I do the main quest on my android and it's a newer version, even if it's a cheaper model.",3,2025-04-21 23:49:46

Storyline is amazing, characters are well designed and combat seems fluid and flashy the way I like it.

sad that i have to give it one star but brotha.. it won't even let me open it. like i've been waiting for the 17 damn GB to download to just do nothing and exit the game in 3 sec. it looks fun ig but 17GB is a lot to just be left with the game exiting on itself.,1,2025-04-21 16:18:20

"Story and Localization could be better, there's lack of presented connection between playable characters except with main character. Combat is fun (Illusive Realm makes it more fun, waiting for its return) and QoL updates very frequent.

been day 1 player and I enjoyed it despite all performance issues and later on with an amazing came back they had in 2.0 but the recent anniversary rewards kind of felt like they ignored players like me that were there since the beginning and focused more on returning and new players but I will give it fair score.,4,2025-04-21 12:00:04

"the game itself is great, but its optimization for a mobile game is not really the best, most ppl who use the phone as their gaming console are the ones not able to get high end devices, so mobile games need to be optimized to be run by majority of the phones, my phones runs most games in the highest graphics (ex: genshin and hsr) but for wuthering, there is a lot of lagging, glitching, frame dropping and crashing, and I mean ALOT",3,2025-04-21 11:53:46

Really disappointing since the upcoming banners are more on females like why are you wasting the game's potential. It should be balanced like wth kuro RELEASE MORE MALE CHARACTERS I'm tired of seeing female characters. Can't you just balance it??? I thought the game would improve since I played wuwa since release and kept hoping that it would not turn to some gooning sht game. REALLY DISAPPOINTING LIKE FRFR.

They never release new 4 stars, and on the rare occasion that they do, they're useless. They've completely stopped releasing male characters, creating a serious imbalance. The Anniversary rewards are horrible, and the ""Outfit Voucher"" only reducing outfit prices by a tiny bit is laughably stingy. I don't think WuWa's good qualities outweigh the bad anymore.

Even HSR gave out a free 5* limited character, imagine. just rework the rewards or banner system atleast so players can feel like they getting something in anniversary don't make wuwa a whale game",1,2025-04-20 20:30:51

Like all gacha games it is gambling. They want your money and will do everything they can to get you hooked but are very reluctant to reciprocate unless forced. That said the 2.0 patch onwards has been very good up to the 2.2 main story which has very good storytelling for such a short runtime. Multiple QoL enhancements and continuous optimization enabling play even on an old gaming laptop with an i7 8th and 1060 6GB bur smartphones will need much better hardware.

I supported WuWa because I truly believe that this game will treat their players right by celebrating TOGETHER with us.,1,2025-04-20 07:44:25

with the 2.3 livestream announcing their rewards for 2.3 that is underwhelming.. considering their reputation for being generous in rewards and listening to player feedback.. they actually ruined my trust. its like their slowly becoming those predatory gacha games from hoyoverse.. their anniversary 12 banners are not even f2p friendly the astrites you can get are just like their ordinary patches . what a pity Kuro games i still believe you can turn things around. until then this is my rating,1,2025-04-20 06:09:51

Do not play this game and if you already do, drop it.",1,2025-04-20 04:58:34
Great game but i really dont understand why devs are ruining WuWa hype train. Anniversary patches should feel for players. Im reading this patch notes and there is a 10x pull that i wont get because im not a returnee. There is another 10x pull i cant even use for the character i want because of timegate. There is no new map etc. That means even with anniversary rewards i will get the regular amount. What was the point of all that 1st anni teaser?

The 1st anniversary livestream is very lackluster. The reward is just a regular patch update with 10 more pulls or more? And they did it along with 10 rerun banners of great characters and 2 characters that is loved by players plus skins. Like they aim to milk the players dry of their wallet. I truly love this game and even spent a bit even though I spent rarely in games but if this is how they treat their players then even I won't tolerate this.

It would be great if the update for the next patch would be similar to Genshin Impact where you only need to download the additional content, downloading 17Gb seems little and short to countries with strong Mbps but not all has that level of internet speed.",4,2025-04-19 17:50:52

"I have been playing this game ever since it's released, I think we all know that the game had a bad start with the voicelines, bugs, lags, etc. As time goes by, the game is getting better, improving so fast. For the style and aesthetics, the models and animations are so cool and unique, although the character designs have more room to improve. The open-world, personally, it looks apocalyptic, still I love every bit of the view through the wilderness. The mechanics make the game fun.",5,2025-04-19 12:17:30

i absolutely Love this game and I know that it has a lot of potential to become one of the best games but there's a main issue I have while playing on my phone. It's none other than the game crashing after a few minutes of gameplay. My phone model is a realme note 50. Plz fix this so I can keep playing without having to reset the game a couple of times thx.,3,2025-04-19 11:38:06
"a really fun game, the combat and exploration tools they give are honestly so fire and make the game more fun. plus if your looking at the ratings trying to see about the cantarella and scar and geshu lin backlash its fake, please look into it and you'll see and the leaker who gave that info was known to be unreliable with his posts",5,2025-04-19 11:31:48

"The gameplay feels like it's only saving grace. The story feels like an isekai. The mc feels like a Mary Sue, and everything revolves around the mc, literally. We have characters that are walking encyclopedias that are engineered to treat the rover like a messiah at every waking moment. Nothing felt earned to garner their trust. Game was advertised with a look on nature & characters reclaim back some pocket of humanity for themselves in a post-apocalyptic world, but it feels the exact opposite",2,2025-04-19 10:29:34

But by far, the stories and lore of this game is what really attracts me, the rollercoaster of emotions when playing through. That rush to find out the ending. And the occasional plot twist.

Sometimes, it cuts out 1 letter or character from a sentence, or it brings you to the top of the conversation even when you are supposed to be below the recent messages. 1 star off isn't overreacting. It really sucks that it's so difficult to communicate with others,especially in co-op, which is one of the things I like the like the most about the game.",5,2025-04-17 08:39:33

This is the best gacha experience I have ever experienced been a day 1 player and it's still hitting although when you do everything like events and what not theres nothing to do so I wish they would add endgame where you can constantly repeat it Idk what reward they could give to make it engaging and feel worth it but I will and continue playing also still convincing my friends to play this over other gachas so yeah very good,5,2025-04-16 19:15:48
"the game's story and gameplay is really good, especially now in 2.X patches, but the lack of male characters and overly sexualized female characters that continuously flirt with the main character is really annoying",3,2025-04-16 19:15:08
Optimise the game for us android users,4,2025-04-16 19:08:44
best gacha game there is lol!!! the only thing i kinda find unsatisfactory is the fact that there are less male characters and storyline needs a little push and lessen fan service between rover and other adult female characters lol nonetheless this game is BOMB AF!!!!,4,2025-04-16 19:01:52
niche game for waifu pullers,1,2025-04-16 18:49:17

"Probably the best open world gacha game out there. Love the story up to Rinascita (havent played much from there sadly) a lot of great characters and combat feels pretty good + the exploration is a lot less tedious. The Hoyoshills trying to mass report the game are wrong btw the ""leaker"" isnt a leaker and the cameltoe cantarella part was a mod",5,2025-04-16 18:33:44
"(I had to do this in my sister's phone lol because my phone can't handle it and I watch with streamers) THIS GAME IS PHENOMENAL! The story telling is so good, the non-cutscenes felt like one and with the reason 2.2, the characters feel so alive and it makes me so invested in the story. Ciaccona is the prime example and she blew me away, I have never seen so much movement before ever since I got hooked into Genshin. The characters designs are spot on! I hope you continue cooking kuro!",5,2025-04-16 18:18:55
i love the game,5,2025-04-16 18:06:32
"I love this game very much, spending hours and hours playing it. But look what is happening right now, I cannot even recognize it anymore. It became WORSE, don't you even care anymore? The harem, the annoying jiggle physics, the fan service, annoying! Also, why do you keep releasing female characters only? like where are the male characters?",2,2025-04-16 17:32:58
"Honestly is my very favorite game, but as the game updates. Its very disappointing I've been playing since release and its been my favorite game ever since. But ever since the rising controversy, is a real disappointment. Its so disappointing, why would the devs add such things? And as being labeled as a game for minors. Are the devs so money hungry that they have to add those particular details? So disappointing",1,2025-04-16 17:29:31

"i uninstalled it after 2.2 :( i played ever since 1.0 it was amazing at first, but i couldn't handle seeing every female character slowly glazing rover repetitively huhu it overshadows the story. maybe ill install it again if scar and geshulin (or any new male characters) become playable cause i, like many others downloaded the game because of them.",1,2025-04-16 16:42:17
"This is honestly the best gacha game you can ask for. Everything is looking well polished because of these devs man!. F2P FRIENDLY and you can get those characters and save up really fast because of these generous rewards. The story and voice acting is getting better at 2.0+. The devs always listen to the community's feedback. Try it, you won't regret it and make sure to finally judge it if you are in the new region.

Used to be good. Now it's apparent they're catering to the WRONG community. You were praised for listening to your players. What happened to it?,2,2025-04-16 14:54:05
The overall game was the Best but My phone has a 8GB ram or 228 GB storage with snapdragon prosser but the game was still lagging even in low settings and the same side I play genshin impact in High graphics but I don't feel any lag accept my phone battery was less than 20% maybe it's because wuthering waves add to much mob because of them game are lagging or crashing. I request you to minimise the quantity of mobs they may help for those players who have an average device. give us good Play.,4,2025-04-16 14:52:32
"I were not a huge fan of wuthering waves on release,in fact even thought of it as just another gacha game and nothing else I gave the game a try and still wasn't a huge fan besides the combat but after what they did with the black shore and Rinascita and the fact that the game have changed so much in such a short time. I can now say Wuthering Waves is the best gacha game I have played so far",5,2025-04-16 14:39:16

The echo exp are too expensive and I really want the echo tuning to have some sort of pity system cause farming for my favourite character is such a pain, I would really want to use the useless echoes as well for exp and not for another echo, overall the game is great, still waiting for the character sigil",4,2025-04-16 08:49:30

"The dev is really putting up an effort to improve the game. The laggy gameplay really improved so much after the updates and it became smoother unlike when the first day it was officially launched in google play. Also, kuro is spoiling us to be honest, I'm so shocked by the number of astrites given to me.

"Solid game overall, immense potential but not for long. The story later on is good, but the exposition is so bad I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Optimization used to be huge but with recent 2.X its getting worse. Character m to f ratio is siginificantly worse now and catered towards male audience. The quality of life and dev generosity is much worse then what it used to be, the game grinding, events, ui, exploration, vfx and animation also starts to get caught by competitors. Not recommended",1,2025-04-16 07:08:37

Great game! Hope it continues to get better and put other greedy gaming companies in the dust.,5,2025-04-16 05:58:11
"Very Linear story so far, every character you meet just fawns over you for no reason. The open world feels vast and there is a lot to explore, but none of it seems to matter or relate back to the main character or the supporting characters, which makes the world...feel empty. Each characters design and combat mechanics feel good, but the action combat is buggy at times. Sometimes you counter when you shouldn't and vice versa, the enemy boss animation or yours clips thru and you do nothing.",2,2025-04-16 05:58:10
you're a good gaming company. Please don't ruin your game by adding too much fanservice. I can barely play the game because canterella is so distracting. I really love this game it'd be sad if it turned out like genshin.,4,2025-04-16 05:53:20

"Absolute best experience I've had across this genre. I've played a LOT of gachas, but this one takes the cake. Combat actually feels good and has some intricacy to it, exploration is fun rather than clunky with unique puzzles and boy oh boy, Kuro goes the extra mile to take care of their players. Every gacha will have some predatory monetization of course, but as far as that goes, I've never seen one thats been this generous to F2P players. Oh and the visuals and cinematics?... CINEMA",5,2025-04-16 05:08:27

I really like the game the explanation is really fun and I actually enjoy it I like the fights they're really unique I don't mind the story quests they're just a bit hard to understand. the only complaint I have is that there is a lack of male characters and it's the only thing really ruining the game for me. I'd really like a few more male characters over anything else.,3,2025-04-16 04:22:46

If this game were to release more male characters and not make everybody simp for the rover, I would literally call this game perfect. Still 5 stars, but please listen. I do appreciate how good this game looks and how polished it is. Cinematics are on point and exploration is very fun while also not too time-consuming.

But for the pity mechanic to not even 100% give you the unit from the banner is scummy. It just says you don't care about your players you care about their money. Better pity mechanics would keep me playing and keep money coming in, instead I feel burned so they got a one time purchase from me and that's it, uninstalling and probably not coming back.",2,2025-04-15 23:29:19

I wish I could post multiple reviews. This game is an absolute blast. Never has a game company listened and catered to their F2P players as much as Kuro. The gameplay and design is top notch. 10/10 Recommended.,5,2025-04-15 21:15:30

"my first impression of the game was i thought it was the same as genshi or genshi copy, but after diving down into the game, I realized that this game is far beyond what I have thought. The world exploration, combats, storytelling, character designs, and quality of life everything is perfect. This game is undeniable one of the best games i ever play. Kuro game deserves our respect.",5,2025-04-15 20:42:10
"After taking a break for a while then coming back for patch 2.0, I can say that Kuro REALLY outdone themselves. Ragunna City brought so much life back into the game and it's great to see this game thriving now. I've been a Day 1 PGR player so I know that Kuro is capable of so many things and I can't wait to see what else the Devs got for us. I will say, the PS5 version of the game needs some work. There's constant stuttering and screen tearing on it. I hope that can get fixed soon",5,2025-04-15 20:36:46

Another gooner game notthing new,1,2025-04-15 19:52:02
Loved that game until they decided that releasing oversexualized childish-looking female characters is more important than listening to their players and releasing some really wanted characters from the Mainstory... very disappointed,2,2025-04-15 19:31:41
it's a bad experience,1,2025-04-15 19:17:04

"Devs listen. There's always gonna be contraversy surrounding a gatcha game but I'd say kuro handles their issues very well.

I hope kuro keeps up the good work.",5,2025-04-15 18:00:23
"the gameplay mechanics are really good especially the dodge mechanics and parry mechanics are insane, the character lore is good, one of the stories almost makes me cry especially the story between shorekeeper, rover and the black shores, If you played this game you never get tired of playing some of the characters. Keep doing your best kuro. I love this game so much üòç",5,2025-04-15 17:56:37

"It was good in the first release but it eventually starts to get boring specially almost every character have feelings to the mc, I played for the combat not for these disgusting sexualized characters also the story is boring asff, It was so good before whyd it turn to a harem game,as a man myself how the woman dress and move in this game are concerning, please do better and treat every character equal because men in this game as well girl mc doesn't get the same treatment as the women and mmc.",1,2025-04-15 16:34:37

"I have no expectations for kuro games' male character roster anymore, I should've known that since I played PGR. (the latest update where there was male character content in PGR was almost A YEAR AGO, and it was just 1 skin/coating) I kept on holding onto my expectations since we all know kuro always listens to player feedback, but till now there isn't any changes. Brant is probably going to be the only male character in patch 2.X iam disappointed but it's my fault for expecting big anyways.",1,2025-04-15 15:39:56
"Don't play unless you're a male gooner who just wants female characters with heavy fanservice - as a day 1 player I can say that the game started with so much charm and potential, but had just become like any other typical harem-like gatcha game.",1,2025-04-15 15:38:30

But, the limited characters are mostly females and that doesn't really appeal to me. not to mention the lack of new 4 star characters. fav characters are really important for me to keep playing the game.

"Wuthering Waves is easily one of the best mobile games out there. The world-building is top-notch, the boss fights are intense and skill-based, and the storyline actually pulls you in. Dodge and parry mechanics feel super smooth and rewarding. It was a bit choppy on my iPhone 11 at launch, but now it runs perfectly. You can tell the devs truly care -they listen, improve, and constantly deliver. This game is a gem. Don't miss it.",5,2025-04-15 13:06:07

my only complaint is a large issue for me. it seems kuro would rather put more effort into jiggle physics than creating more playable male characters. uninstalling until they release another male unit,2,2025-04-15 03:52:49

"Really fun game, even better than Genshin Impact at the moment! Huonglong's story was a bit dry and tedious to get through, and the voice acting was a bit mid, but once Rinascita released it was an amazing breath of fresh air!

"Kuro made a interesting, albeit a tad slow paced open world game that was very enjoyable in the beginning. But now the game feels more like a harem, soft-core hentai advertisement game. there was no reason to include a camel toe on Cantrellas character model. There's fanservice then there's softcore porn, the lack of male characters is a joke now too BTW. Scar is most likely unplayable and they'll probably just release a unbuffed Calcharo alone for 3.0. Pretty game. nice rewards, incel devs.",2,2025-04-15 02:08:58

it started good . but just 2 days ago i was planning to buy jinshi's outfit which is expensive by the way. the very same day i got to know that they altered the design of another character who is already released and people had that character including me. and even for minor adjustments it is a scam to the players. kuro games lost my trust. dont become genshin impact which i left for becoming a childish game .,1,2025-04-14 17:04:44

"The best gacha game i have ever played. I'm in love with the character designs and combat and the post-apocalyptic setting. 2.0 is insane! Edit: 2.2 was an AMAZING patch in every way possible. Story, Avinoleum map and the side stories from within, character introduction for Carthetiya and Cantarella, fixing Whimpering Wastes and pretty chill and rewarding events. One thing that i'd like is that you add 120 fps support for Ryzen 5 series too( i play 99% on PC)",5,2025-04-14 06:17:53

The story, especially in 2.0, is comparable to AAA titles, the animations are amazing, combat is fluid and over all, it is very fun to play. I love the character designs, Changli is my favorite so far, Canterella is their newest character and she's way more than just fan-service.

Censored Cantarella after her release but kept it for Carlotta and Roccia. Just for you to understand the problem. The devs drew so called camel toe for those characters.

I think the exploration in Wuthering Waves is the best I've ever experienced and the grapple and flight features make it incredibly easy and relaxing for me, also the unlimited sprint.

the game is great but the optimization not too great compared to genshin it's run smoother even in high graphics but this game isn't that optimize on moderate end phone like mine so hopefully you fix this because it's almost unplayable (fyi: I don't play low because it's terrible I want a realistic look even though my phone is dying),3,2025-04-13 05:10:56

Mungkin hologram challenge di buat jadi bisa di mainkan di mode Coop hanya saja stats boss nya menjadi naik ketika di mainkan di mode Coop, jadi itu bisa membutuhkan kerja sama dan asik untuk dimainkan di Coop bersama teman!",4,2025-04-12 00:44:03

"Unfair Backlash from Non-Players Wuthering Waves is a great game with amazing visuals and gameplay. Sadly, it's being targeted by people posing as concerned parents who clearly don't play it. Their mass complaints seem aimed at sabotaging Kuro Games' success, not offering real feedback. As a paying player, it's frustrating to see the game penalized because of this. Real fans appreciate the effort behind it‚Äîhope Kuro keeps pushing forward.",1,2025-04-11 20:05:16

"The game was good but by now you can tell that the developers have decided to just throw the entire game away and instead aim to create a game for misogynistic porn addicts and it makes the game and community unbearable. The women are designed to be like sex dolls for men with a bland self-insert MC, and their characters are written to fit into men's sex fantasies, like why would you make a female character with a camel toe who acts like a trad wife.

And yet till this day I have never won a single 50/50. 2nd is I have completed all other tactical holograms and other tough challenges but the Tempest Memphis one is definitely buggy. The moment you think you're winning and get his hp below 50%, your dodge and counter will stop working. I can hear the sound of the counter and the dodge slow-mo but still you'll take damage and die somehow.",1,2025-04-10 21:51:24

"Gotta be honest, The game is awesome, great action with stunning visuals. The battle mechanics are different for each character and so much so that each character can be built and be used. The character designs are just too good, and finally a game where the Main character both looks great and is actually awesome in-game, like Rover is just so great that I think everyone can say he/she is one of the best DPS in the game. Also Kuro is too generous and listens to us, love you Kuro goodluck. Try it",5,2025-04-10 20:26:42
"The graphics are really great, but the rendering distance is bad, at least on mobile, and sometimes wall of building or floor doesn't load properly, and shadow of characters, in cut scenes, becomes pixelated.

"Its been a year after dropping Hoyoverses most popular games and my selection had been dry since. However, I can very happily say that playing this game was the best choice I've made. It offers you an enticing storyline, unique combat, and wide exploration while even giving optional quality life experience. Playing this game has a better feel to it than most other 3D Adventure RPG's I played, it's different and in a good way! With this game I feel like viewers and myself are heard.

"This is one of the best games I've ever played. The story, the events and everything else is great imo and very rewarding as well.

Absolutely stellar gacha open world game imo. This is the most rewarding gacha game experience I have had so far. The combat system is challenging and fun with mechanics and world especially since v2.0 has been phenomenal. And the real plus point of the game is that it's very f2p friendly and the devs take the feedback and improve the game constantly. You also won't be forced to get every new character or weapon that gets released. Long may the quality continue. Good job Kuro Games.,5,2025-04-10 11:59:03

"I love this game but I have to uninstall it, takes too much space. I love the graphics and character design tho",4,2025-04-09 17:21:31
The graphics are great and the story is mostly interesting with some great character designs (the camel toe on the latest character when her outfit gets wet is vile and I wish I could unsee it). The problem lies with the game dissolving into yet another hideously dull harem fantasy. With formerly well written and newer badly written female characters falling at the male version of the main characters feet. Incredibly disappointing.,1,2025-04-09 16:44:49

Also, they have improved with the storytelling, and they did not fall flat this time! I also like that they have reruns for banners that I wasn't able to get certain characters for, so it was worth supporting the devs for this.

"Pros: This mobile gacha game offers the best graphic quality for an open world game, a great story, more battle experience, more rewards for drawn characters, guaranteed limited weapons and you can choose standard weapons. Cons: You need a mid-range device for a better gaming experience, which makes sense considering the game uses Unreal Engine 4",5,2025-04-08 12:07:53

Incredible attention to detail in all the small aspects and gives players a great visual gaming experience. Smooth transitions between interfaces, well-written stories and characters with vivid personalities and backgrounds are all amazing selling points. Even the interactions between NPCs feel human and relatable. There are minimal downsides to this game.",5,2025-04-07 22:33:51

I already have all standard 5 star characters after only playing for a month. and now on 2.2 I already have multiple copies of different 5 stars and even carlota and her signature weapon. this is the first game I felt confident in for pulling a character and their signature weapon. I also love the combat system of the game. this game is overall fun to play and also very free to play/casual player friendly,5,2025-04-07 21:27:11

The is so unfair it might have a lot of rewards but the performance. The game is always stopping and a lot of glitching. For a mobile player its unfair because they are putting more on the effects more than the players fps making it so lag and glitchy. I hope they fix this.,1,2025-04-07 19:56:28

"Wuthering Waves is a new ceiling for mobile games.From rich vibrant world building to console level graphics to skilled combat, this offers it all! The developers listen to their fanbase and QQL changes every patch. One of the better games available on playstore. The only downside to it is that it needs a really good device (probably a SD 7 gen 2 or MD 7200 for a stable gameplay at 30 FPS). Overall it's highly recommende for new players who wants to explore a new world and enjoy a rich story.",5,2025-04-07 13:10:40

"FPS is better now - finally! eh, but still can't rate for five stars? why? Because of: too big and long grind. Like: it's crazy, I have to farm a lot of resources + try to drop a significant weapon for a char which also took months! another weird decision: the price for character outfits. The reason I am donating in Punishing Gray Raven a lot and not thinking about doing it here; because of the price for that outfit. even at first realize with discount - it's insane.

"the game is fine if you enjoy plain fighting or exploration but for people who value good story, well written characters, interaction between characters and actual development, don't even waste your time downloading much less playing.

"Wuthering Waves is good but I am alarmed at the lack of 4 star characters and male to female ratio. They could easily make a quickswap, aero erosion, spectro frazzle 4* support but won't. If you are going to make hyperspecific teams or niche characters, make sure there is a 4 star alternative. At the moment, you have to pull 5 star characters to complete a team. Aero rover cannot even apply aero erosion. You will need Phoebe. Worst part is, I will probably never get to change this rating.",1,2025-04-06 09:00:49

It's a shame the launch of the game was rushed so much, and so many things lack polish since I know kuro can make amazing games, but this release has been terrible. edit as of 2.2, they have improved everything. The story is compelling, the characters are interesting, the music is great, and exploration is amazing.",5,2025-04-06 07:22:07

"Wuwa has demonstrated what Open World Anime based style RPG needed in gamers community. Not only a vast exploration and solo/party component, it also brings new QoL and changes that usually NOT added in any different same game style becoming the best seller game even less than a year since this review posted. Also they brought massive rewards to all of us whos consistently play each patch and much more to you newers. Totally recommend!!! üëç",5,2025-04-05 18:18:32

"this game is absolutely beautiful, but there's a problem with it. wherever I try to play on my android tablet, I lag, and I can not put the quality higher than the standard one since it lags a lot, even if it's really low. whenever I try to go further into the story, I always crash. that's why I usually need to play on my iPhone, so I don't lag or crash.

"I don't think there needs to be an explanation on how good these devs are. Ever since coming to this game from HSR and Genshin, it has been a life changer for me. This game is like no other for me. I remember seeing an ad on tik tok to preregister for the game and i thought why not since it looked a lot like genshin. Turns out I'm still playing it from day 1. This gacha game is amazing and I wouldn't do anything to replace this game or the devs that actually care and listen to the WUWA community",5,2025-04-05 09:38:33
"Every patch this game strays further away from being a mobile game it really is becoming more catered to pc and high end phones cuz if you don't have those you'll have to bear huge fps drops like ur diagnosed with schizo and with the graphics and experience like it's an unpolished game with polygon ah graphics, oh what's that I didn't know I was playing the love child of Minecraft 2 and DMC but I'm always high and schizophrenic like my grandpa on a saturday night",2,2025-04-05 09:25:48

"Gameplay is is good, graphic was pretty, but thats it, every single patch is just girls gooning over MC, the story is barely surface level with no substance this game almost feels like a Galge/Dating Sim with how much the devs romanced MC with Female Chars, the characters barely interact with each other, it felt like they have no life outside the MC so the world felt very empty",1,2025-04-05 05:55:13

"The game story and graphics are beyond expectations, but events are time gated, not allowing you to finish them in 1 day, and if you miss playing days you might not be able to get the rewards you want. Absolutely horrendous unlike the other gacha games where it is possible to rush the event in 1 day when you have no time. Furthermore, you need a decently operating phone in order to play it. I play on a Samsung s24 fe and the game keeps bugging out and crashing. Do not recommend playing this game",1,2025-04-05 03:01:57

My opinion 1.[fix lag issues for android](keep crashing out when playing) 2.[I hope either ciaccona or zani be free please] 3.[Make more cool character that has different gameplay than focusing on the type of weapon] 4. Please make more (gusts of welkins-4 bosses monster)] 5. make each region sentinels echo please (i really want the sentinel of rinascita to be usable)[the design caught my heart]. 6. More reward 7.

It's got great graphics but the game play is really annoying as it forces you to fight a boss in a guide and that boss is clearly made too strong for its level as I go 10 levels above it and it still one-shot my units if it's in a in-game guide it probably should be fair for beginners a lot of enemy's do this where they do way to much damage then some enemy's deal nearly no damage",5,2025-04-04 12:17:45

"I liked the game, the story was ok. Characters were forgotten along the way with no story relavence. A clear favoritism for male players with the way they design female characters. At first it was fine, unique designs and not so creepy. Shorekeeper didn't really seem to fit in with her design but just ignored it. Now with the release of Cantarella and their disgusting design choice for her lower body and it shows the direction they're heading. No respect for female characters or players.",2,2025-04-04 10:50:09

"thank you for listening Kuro! ive been struggling to find best possible damage and some events is using time-based which is my biggest enemy. but newest events battle without time-based is really helping me. time-based events, especially battle, is hard because even tho i have 73% crit rate and 250% crit damage, i still barely reach the highest possible damage. i sometimes lost the event rewards cuz my damage isnt high enough to kill enemies before time running out. keep that for upcoming events",5,2025-04-04 09:40:05

Honestly this is how a game should be, respecting it's players base.",5,2025-04-04 09:04:25

it seemed like kuro was addressing the performance issues and it was getting better. but since the release of 2.1 lagging in combat to the point of the game being unplayable and huge cuts in frame rates. I've gone over the wuthering waves subreddit and I'm not the only one having this issue. even p.c players have noticed roughly a 50% decrease in performance and have had to adjust settings down significantly. unfortunately the performance has gotten so bad for me I've had to uninstall.,1,2025-04-04 02:18:59

"Best gacha game I've ever play so far. Patch 2.0 is just peak story writing, the devs hands down the most active devs ever in history of anime style game. Their confidence in their own story is shown in the willingness to put skip button. Basically saying, if our story is boring, you can skip it, and holy hell, they really cook a solid one that I haven't skip a single part in the major quest. My complain is the lack of good 4 stars characters, and surely, lack of male characters.",5,2025-04-03 20:09:12

I have dimensity 8200 chipset and it's still struggling to run on balanced settings (medium graphics) I try to tweak some settings to make it look good and smooth at the same time and it's still has some fps drop. overall, I love the story, lore and combat of the game. keep it up especially in the optimization. keep cooking kuro üî•üî•",4,2025-04-03 19:17:39
"Needs optimization on battery. I know it uses Url engine or smt but battery cost too high on mobile phone. Good audio on android phone unlike in Ps5.. audio, voices, skill sounds loses every second and the fps drops, not consistent 60 fps. It doesn't lag on high end device but battery consumption must be optimized. All good performance here on android but PlayStation version is poorly managed.. Do something about it and fix it, Kuro.

Optimization, QoL Changes, Events, Story, Gameplay, all the possibilities that Kuro devs delivers always nailed me (Especially 2.0 and 2.2, which was A PEAK).

The devs simply always avoid to indirectly buff Lingyang. Even with Nightmare Lampy Lumen Myrad, it is put in a set like Empyrean Anthem and Frosty Resolve, just to avoid buffing Lingyang.

Best Open world Gacha game Right now.,5,2025-04-03 08:03:23
"I really love this game! The character designs are great, and the world is beautiful. The method of collecting echoes through open-world battles is awesome, and I personally enjoyed the story (I made it through the first main quest). The only thing is, I struggle so much to play on my device. I don't think it's something to criticize the game over, but it's honestly almost unplayable. Could you maybe have a cloud version? It made another game I've played work perfectly on my device~",5,2025-04-03 06:48:23

"I feel like the animations are stiff and unnatural. The cut scenes are fine. Audio quality feels bad for some reason, bad volume balancing at times as well. Good base game (but hard to mean it as a compliment when it clearly took ""inspirations""). Quality is improving with time so that's good. Quick swap gameplay won me over.",4,2025-04-03 04:56:15

"This is the best open-world gacha game I've played so far. The generosity of the Kuro developers and willingness to improve their game through surveys and reading critics are what attract me to this game. I have been playing for months, and I am truly satisfied with every patch. Where each patch is another cooking. Good job, Kuro.

The world-building is still lacking, when I visit certain places, they feel empty, as if they have no story at all. I hope kuro continue delivers. for me Wuwa got 4.8/5",4,2025-04-02 12:51:05

It's clear you won't stop with rover harem reducing all female characters to just another fanservice. Atleast don't sexualize youthful and mentally unstable and the easily manipulated trope in sexualized clothes as camellya. Make as many waifus but don't put characters like camellya and katixia in the story or give us an option to avoid such things. Pheobe for example is fine because she's youthful but clothed. Carlotta is fine too because she seems well put together and not too revealing,1,2025-04-02 02:33:59

"In terms of story, extremely weak opening during 1.0 but rapidly picks up til 1.4. Now 2.0 onwards sets a high precedent among 3D open world action RPG gachas. Amazing storytelling. Fantastic combat. Outstanding open world traversal. Reasonable gacha elements. However, game needs improvements on the gearing system and co-op. Keep cooking Kuro. The final rating will be on the game's 1st anniversary.",4,2025-04-01 22:10:04

To be honest the game is really good I enjoyed over a month but in the same time I also experience lag and heat on my device. Optimization is my request right now.,4,2025-04-01 21:34:50
"The best game in my opinion, and definitely a breath of fresh air after Genshin. I love the gameplay, and I love the mechanics. The characters might need a bit more work, but the diverse animations and the lore really made up for it. I don't mind female playable characters, but I do wish there's more male characters. Kuro Games seem like they have the potential to make good-looking male characters than Genshin, I hope we have more characters like Brant, Aalto, Xiangli Yao, etc. Overall, amazing!",5,2025-04-01 21:33:17

I stayed for the potential the game seems to have had, and the phenomenal combat experience. Fast forward not even a year, the game is absolutely amazing. Story experience now feels like a movie, character writing and music are ridiculously good, and world design is a huge step up from a few months ago. Great balancing, and very generous on the gacha.

I hear static noises as I'm playing the game. Sometimes during battle scenes when you move your character around, you can't fight the enemy very well due to hesitation & trying to freeze up.

Dear developers of Wuwa Iam so hype about this Game!!!! And it's very awesome. And the storyline is unique. There is no problem about the game but there's one and that is lag it's very laggy and it destroys the gameplay of my character. But I hope that you will fix these issues because whenever I play Genshin the graphics don't lag because I know my phone fits to play this wonderful game. So I hope you will fix this so everyone will enjoy this wonderful game.... Thank you üòäüòäüòä,3,2025-03-31 17:37:29

Hence, I uninstalled the game, I top up for nothing. all effort collecting astrite from event and top up becomes nothing. this game pays to win game. especially whimpering wastes event and TOA event. this game not friendly for new players",1,2025-03-31 15:31:13

I love this game absolutely but there is a slight issue. The player animation and animation of other things and the jumping animation should be a little better other wise it's good. the player jumping is a little too and it's a bit awkward.,5,2025-03-30 13:30:39

"What a glow-up this game became! Everything has improved since Rinascita released. The story and music have vastly improved, and the devs improve the game every update. What was once a messy game with some interesting ideas is now a more coherent experience. While I don't expect WuWa to remain great forever (I'm burnt by Genshin), what's here is very enjoyable. Still has some trivial issues, like no option to rotate the minimap, but far less egregious than Genshin's longstanding problems.",4,2025-03-30 10:55:37

"An updated review with patch 2.2. The story portrayed in this patch was excellent; in that it answered our questions regarding the sentinel and the threnodian, the identity of the Blessed Maiden, and brought with it some very unexpected twists. This main-story patch & companion story, imho, is the best currently that you have put out; The cinematography, camerawork, animations, and cutscenes provided the players with a very satisfactory experience. 2.X is an absolute blast. Keep it up!",5,2025-03-30 08:58:02

"The game already has developed up to a really great point, story, gameplay, graphics and music included. After experiencing the 2.2 story i can only say that it's hands down one of the best. Haven't experienced such a refined story with so many emotions racing as you play in a gacha game as it even stomps on many other games and stories outside of it's genre. An absolutely beautiful version and a masterclass work. Full props to the company. Keep up evolving and delivering epicness like this.",5,2025-03-30 08:27:15
didn't expect to play this far. wow,5,2025-03-30 08:19:16
"Progression system is mostly copycat from other gacha games. And of course very slow. 50/50 system is good for the company, but not for f2p. I play other similar games and winning or losing first char in this one was the deciding factor if to continue playing. It's not a bad game, just a predatory business model. Wish we could get smth between this and PGR. World is beautiful, combat is okay. The story is interesting but overloaded with terms and unusual names. Not a fan of most chars desi",1,2025-03-30 08:12:19
"Patch 2.2 is the best gacha game i've ever played. The Lore, Storytelling, Music, Epic Boss Fight and The Main Character everything is perfect.

I truly enjoy this game, it's something I can actively look forward to spending my time on, even after a hard day! Sure, it does have its flaws (e.g.the performance -low end to above average devices- still leave a lot of room for improvement) but it's ruled out by ALL the work these devs do!

Been playing this game since released and here's some note for anyone who wants to play it on mid device: - uninstall then reinstall it every new big update bcs it will lag to the point that you can't even play it anymore. -use the lowest graphic as possible atp until the bar is green. -make sure you clear any app before since it will affect your experience. -you can't listen to music when playing bcs there's an app running in the background.

"Update: I redownloaded it, new changes. Still bad quality, drains my battery. No more crashes but laggy af. No incentive to play other than gacha. Old: It's playable, but the quality is so bad! It's blurry, and the tutorial doesn't teach anything! The characters have the most cringe stories, and the free rewards don't allow for me to pull on anything but the character banners when I want to pull for the weapon banner.

"I hope you are doing well. I have been enjoying [Weathering Waves] recently, but I am experiencing severe lag while playing, despite my device having good specifications.

"+ Best mobile game I've ever played. Latest patch was amazing. The storytelling has significantly improved since launch and it keeps getting better. The animated combat scenes during story missions makes it so much more enjoyable. Gameplay is just top-notch üëå - Echo stat rng is still such a drag but it is a somewhat necessary evil to an extent. Also, losing multiple 50/50s in a row sucks. Can't there be a way to mitigate this where there's a limit to how many times you lose? Great game still",5,2025-03-29 09:08:25

"A very good and visually stunning gacha game. Not the most generous gacha I've ever played (that would be PGR) but as a f2p casual player it's been pretty good so far! Kuro Games has proven themselves to be very dedicated to making Wuthering Waves the best it can be, and has been very attentive to player feedback.

In addition to the technical issues such as lag and glitches, the characters and storyline is so dull. the overwhelming amount of female characters is so boring and the fan service is unnecessary and exaggerated.

"People may disagree with me on this but recent character designs in Wuwa are just questionable. They are not bad, just feel extremely over sexualized (especially female characters), to the point that I actually feel uncomfortable looking at them. It was fine until Changli, after that everyone has 1 piece of fabric as their costume and breathing boo-. The recent Cantarella's showcase is the last straw for me. I just know that I have to quit despite loving Wuwa so much (been playing since launch).",2,2025-03-29 01:07:51

It had promise, but it felt like it was wading in deeper waters than it should've. Now, in 2025? I can confidently say this is one of the best gacha we have around, and honestly, I'd argue that it's just an extremely solid game even if you decide only to play w/ F2P units.

The game is very laggy even though I have set my graphics settings to the lowest. I followed the advice to delete and reinstall the game, and I also have plenty of storage space, so I‚Äôm not sure why it‚Äôs still lagging or why the black screen issue keeps happening every time I play. Hope u fix it :)",3,2025-03-28 16:57:12

"Probably the best game of its genre. The combat is fluid, reasonably varied, and overall fun. The story is decent, and you can skip parts that don't interest you. Character design was initially weak but is now up there with Hoyo games. If this game had the courage to unsaddle itself from some of the toxic vestiges of its genre (stamina system, time-gated events), it would be a near-perfect game. Unfortunately, they don't trust players enough to let them off the daily grind leash.",4,2025-03-28 08:38:03
"The gameplay is so good, (like, parry, dodge, animation cancel) but I'd prefer if they add more male characters and improve on the character design, it feels a bit empty, but overall, it's fun. so many things to do in there.

"Wuthering Waves has come a long way and improved upon it's weaknesses to the point it's not controversial to call it the best Gacha game out there right now. although the optimization could still be improved upon the game runs almost smoothly, story and characters are as immersive as usual and the combat has gained even more depth and skill expression.",4,2025-03-27 22:16:27
hell bro like is game too much. I started Wuthering waves 1yr ago and otherwise I like animes soo this game is perfect download now,5,2025-03-27 22:14:00
"This game is great, imo the highlighted aspect of this game is the combat. The combat is amazing and fun, it's not repetitive, it serves a brand new combat experience. The exploration is fun too. It's just the performance, different devices can cause different performance. Even though, the performance is already amazing considering the features in this game.",5,2025-03-27 22:13:20
Wuwa has become more and more unstable for every update for low end devices. it seems like I can't even play it for 5 minutes without crashing. Can't even buy a new device cause it's not like my phone's broken or old enough.,1,2025-03-27 22:05:42
I just gave it a 4 cus everyone says it's good but my game crashes right when I try to login can y'all devs make it a bit more low end device friendly so even players like us can play it or something like genshin cloud with limited time but with better queue if you read this thank you for reading the review and try to listen unlike genshin,4,2025-03-27 22:05:03

"Don't go and give something that have no real usage for mobile players. It's just lazy, annoying and such a disappointment to see the game currently trying to be near it's PC and PS5 counterpart. If you want to improve the game to work decently as it is on mobile, at least implement something useful such as power saving mode. As the current update it is now, I just have zero expectations on what's to come and with all the ignored suggestions from the surveys, this game will soon be the next Hoyo",1,2025-03-27 21:37:39

Was going to recommend this game to Genshin impact players whom left because of the lack of Lumine support. But lately Kuro has been showing more favoritism torwards the male mc in promo videos. So I don't know how much this game will last with showing both mcs. Course if you don't care about that kind of stuff the gameplay and graphics are pretty good.,4,2025-03-27 19:34:33

honestly can't stop playing this game. it is my favorite and it is peak RPG gaming. the graphics and gameplay are absolutely out of this world and kuro does such a phenomenal job making a amazing story with rich and deep lore. they really nail it on the head with attention to detail and are extremely generous and giving to their community and players. they listen very well to what we want and give it. I happily spend my money on this game and have zero regrets. truly a game that has captured me.,5,2025-03-27 11:40:21

exceptional gacha game that listens to its playerbase. characters are also really well designed.,5,2025-03-27 06:03:36
"It's good actually, but there's a lot of improvements needed on: ‚Ä¢The Smoothness of the Graphics and the gameplay. ‚Ä¢The Auto Lock randomly target some enemies far away while your fighting an enemy in front of you. ‚Ä¢The Shader is Bad. ‚Ä¢Lastly, The Storyline. You just packed a lot of information at the start which will ruin the game knowing that there are different kinds players. But It's good for me because of how generous this game is that the other Open World Games doesn't.",5,2025-03-27 06:02:13
"tbh the best open world game i play, i tried many open world game before this. this is the best one even required high end spec for mobile, the most important thing is DEV LISTEN TO THEIR PLAYER. the only thing i hope they make more optimization for mobile. atleast many player with not high end spec device can enjoy this game without worries !!",5,2025-03-27 05:54:47

A player since day 1 with a mid phone (Redmi Note 10 Pro); never experienced any bugs/lags or anything in the same genre. 1.0 started off well for me and definitely getting better as what we have up until 2.1 (the fishing event is heck fun!). Engaging parry/dodge combat + set of combo (not smashing button). An insurmountable amount of freedom of an open world which is 90% what makes me stay with Wuthering Waves. Fully F2P and never hit the paywall. Devs definitely listen to their players.,5,2025-03-27 04:50:00

"I love this game a lot. It has great game play and characters, I absolutely love the cutscene looking gacha animations. But I really wish there were more character interactions. It's really hard for me to do some quests because of the amount of Rover interactions there are. I was expecting more interactions between other characters for 1.3-1.4, but sadly, it was all mostly Rover. Hopefully, Kuro could make more character interactions for 2.0 in the future.",5,2025-03-27 04:07:49

The game is really great but the current experience is quite poor. The game crashes quite often and the lag is brutal.

All the mission power scales with the player's max level is also very nice touch, making you not feel pressured to grind everyday.

"Best gacha games and F2P friendly games! I started playing this game since version 1.1. And to be honest, the scenery, the combat style, and the utilities is a game-changing for gacha games. even Kuro Games often gives us compensation with the reward of Astrite as a sign of apology for bugs in-game and gratitude to their players every update, very humble developer. Thank you Kuro Games for making the best gacha games. Wuthering waves is my first gacha games and I don't regret choosing this game!",5,2025-03-23 15:25:33

"It's easy to get burnt out playing this game. Hours upon hours of farming for no results. The content is repetitive and dull after a while. Graphics are bad on mobile, even for a mid-range phone like mine. The story is rather bland too. Character design-wise, I feel that there is too much fanservice and not much beyond that. Tldr, some potential improvements could be: 1) Adding an afk farm similar to HSR. 2) More variety in events. 3) More creativity in story plot and character design.",1,2025-03-22 12:56:22

"The game script is definitely will make you feel like the ""canon"" protagonist is the M Rover. I hate the way this game females had some heavy ""flirting"" for the protagonist. I think that you're making this game to copy genshin by having the both genders as options... I mean that's fine, but... Definitely should improve the writing script for F Rover by adding the male characters. I feel like she was the 2nd protagonist comparing to the M Rover, evethought they were the same person",3,2025-03-20 05:28:31

"As of 2.0, almost every issue I had with the game has been fixed. Story pacing is much better, music works more, in-combat lag is much less prevalent (but still exists). Incredible work. One minor critique is that Echo effects appear to be become character exclusive as of the 2.0 and beyond units using a set no one else can. Please don't go down this route, customization and experimentation is the lifeblood of these games.",4,2025-03-15 23:44:48

"It's a great game and I love everything they do. It's like they took genshin, made their own unique verion of it, and improved on it in every way. The exception being the story genshin still has the better story imho but it's getting close as well. Also Kuro definitely cares more about their customers at the end of the day. The lengths they go to comparatively to implement QOL improvements, listen to their fanbase, and the level of rewards/freebies they give out is night and day",5,2025-03-15 01:17:48

UI when levelling up characters where you have to find the items on the map, but when you exit, you go back to the main screen instead of the Character screen.

The gameplay is wonderful! Combat feels very fluent and really does capture that anime aesthetic perfectly. On mobile it is a little janky with controls but it's nothing game breaking. However, despite having a great written story the English voice acting is really bad in some spots of the game.",4,2025-03-14 02:30:07

Actually an incredible game with passionate devs. Exploration and story is fast paced compared to the slog that is genshin. Teams of 3 and lots of ways to get pulls makes this game incredibly free to play. Gorgeous character designs and animations along with one of thebest combat systems out there.

"Wuthering Waves is a great game that offers an engaging and action-packed experience. The combat system is fluid and satisfying, with a wide range of skills and abilities to master. The open world is vast and beautiful, with plenty of secrets to discover and adventures to embark on. The story is also intriguing, with a mix of sci-fi and fantasy elements that keep players invested. Overall, Wuthering Waves is a must-try for any fans of action RPG",5,2025-03-12 08:17:11

"The game is enjoyable, with amazing combat and great scenery. However, it contains significant Yuri content, which may not be suitable for children under 13. Additionally, the story feels weak at times, primarily revolving around female characters falling in love with the main character.",1,2025-03-10 20:02:26
highlighting only female characters who are OVERLY OBSESSED WITH THE MAIN CHARACTER how about you only release female characters from now on in fact delete all male characters. It's fine to highlight female characters but they don't have to be OBSESSED FREAK THAT DOESN'T SERVE THE PLOT PICK ME GIRLS. The somnoire was interesting BUT PUT SOME DIVERSITY IN IT.

"While its still a gacha game with the purpose of draining your life savings, its a better experience than Genshin, you could run on walls, fly around in rinascita, and your skill in the game matters more than the characters you have in clearing higher level content, dailies take around 5-15 minutes if you're quick which is nice, and the game usually gives you enough pulls so you could save for characters you really want without paying a single cent.

"Absolutely unplayable on low-end devices. The app crashes every few minutes, sometimes even before it fully loads. It lags so badly that even navigating the menu feels like a challenge.

This game is pretty good. Although almost like every gacha game it lacks that 'Men characters'. I mean I get the point of fan servicing but... Still I find it too much in tdy's days game. I would love plus I know many ppl will love to have cool MEN characters.. And boys will love too. So this is the only down side I have. Although a nice game.. Better than most of the Gacha games. It is f2p friendly and I love the fact that they respect player's time and give shortcuts and easy way to farm.‚ù§üíñ,4,2025-03-08 16:37:26

"I wish I could give 5 stars from what I have seen from other people's gameplays this seems like an awsome game and I was so excited but at launch, I could barely play the first few quests before the game started crashing, and since then somehow each version the lag of the server just got worse, my ping is always red and my phone always heats up only with this game, crashing every 5 mins, I have much larger games which work fine too this is the only 1 that struggles..I wish it could be fixed :(",1,2025-03-07 00:21:31

Solid gacha game with the new 2.0 and 2.1 updates. The new zone is very polished and introduces flight to add a new way to explore all of the peaks and valleys. Most content is very laid back and you can roam at your own pace. Obtainable characters skew female. Spending on character pulls seems a bit pricey but you get a decent amount of freebies each patch.,5,2025-03-06 22:17:35

I used 100 spin on new brant character and there gave only lion character which we get for free. Game spin system is total trash. They don't give any good character. This game is money game. So I am deleting it. Don't use money if you can use little because you need mush more to atleast open 1 character and max it. Because 100 spin are not enough to open new character.,1,2025-03-06 12:24:51

5/5 stars an extraordinary open world Gacha game. Character designs are unique and fun. the world building is also excellent with fun structures and different ones in each regions offering an experience. The bosses are hard but not impossible which can be done with enough time and patience. And mainly this masterpiece can be played on a mid performance device and the graphics and the fps are as good as some Triple A games which makes it a gem among the Gacha games. I thank all the devolopers.,5,2025-03-04 16:22:59

The gameplay is just breathtaking. But there is only one issue for me that is I play in Asia server and the ping is always high like 300 ms. The high ping does not affect the gameplay but still it annoys me. Just few updates ago this issue was not there so maybe do something to fix this. ( I play wuwa both pc and mobile therefore this ping issue resides in both platforms.),5,2025-03-04 10:32:30

Dev's listen. Awesome exploration and storytelling. Best gacha game. 10/10 genshin could never,5,2025-03-04 05:00:50
The game's combat style is fun the story's plot is good the music is above average and the graphics are stunning only issue is that the game's optimization for less powerful devices is bad as my device can handle other titles with almost similar visuals or graphics at about medium to high graphics with no issues getting 45+ FPS maybe even 50+ with minimal amounts of stutters but this game stutters too much even at the lowest graphics possible where it's unplayable for me honestly,2,2025-03-04 03:02:40

"I am happy with the updates that fixed my problems I highly recommend the game for those who want a fast paced action game, I have a suggestion, where your game data can be transfered to another server, I got many stuff in the Asia server however these past weeks, the game just stops at the loading screen I do not know if it's a server issue, so I don't really if this will apply but, I would like to see it implemented for players who have their data just limited to one server",5,2025-03-03 14:40:18

"This game is one of those gems, that doesn't initially show, how much beauty and horror it has. Childlike characters seem to be more mentally mature and resilient than adult ones. The Somnoire artistry is giving shivers. The Grand War was the BANG. It's mind-bending, how horrid monsters gradually appear to be more approachable and less fear-inducing. The atmosphere and the landscapes are overwhelmingly enchanting or haunting, and yet they even change together with my perspective and the story.",5,2025-03-02 07:47:16

I love the colours and the vibrancy. They characters are so well made and there isn't a problem with meta unlike other games. I definitely recommend playing it!,5,2025-03-01 04:06:54
iam really frustrated that the game always shows the low connection 450 to 650ms even when the my network connection is good. when I play genshin impact the connection is 150 to 160ms and in Free fire it's 70 ms. please optimise the game and network connection issue to play too smoothly. I dont have any other complaints than this one I really loved the game. only this problem is frustrating.pleaseee,4,2025-03-01 04:03:22

"The echo system needs an overhaul, remove the tuners and add something to reroll stats, trashing echoes should give echo exp. Speaking of stats... The flat hp, def, atk etc. sub-stats should be removed as well, 90% of the time, you don't even need them. Mobile optimisation is still pretty bad but I guess thats what you get from unreal Engine. It has gotten better but still runs best at the lowest settings so I'd recommend only playing this game on high end device with a good processor.",3,2025-03-01 02:05:46

I am really enjoying this game. The world is beautiful and large with plenty of puzzles and hidden treasures to discover. My first pulled character Phoebe made traversing the map faster and is very fun to play on mobile and PC. The combat is simple for a beginner but has depth as you learn more mechanics. I hope more players discover this gem and support the company because I look forward to many more updates in the future.,5,2025-02-28 21:48:05

Great that they have a skip button, but It's story is mediocre at best. The main quests have been phenomenal, but the side quests just feel like a chore. 80 pulls for a 5 star is great, but grinding becomes a headache.

I've been wanting to play this game since i ever saw it come out in socmed platforms. I pre-registered for this game but playing seems to be a hassle since the app freezes and automatically closes every 5-10 mins. It's been like this since it came out that's why i uninstalled it.

Nice game. The dystopian/sci-fi setting are all great! The game itself has no issues. The optimization is well optimized. But one thing about it. You should encourage some of the players of wuwa to not hate on other games like genshin impact. That game has no connection to Wuwa and it's genre. But it's kinda giving me the ick where I see edgy wuwa players always barking and trash talking another game. I can sense that this community has some of the most toxic players online.,4,2025-02-27 01:08:22

Co-op event (racing) not for me it's mid. I prefer co-op boss rush/combat.

"very amazing story writing, unlike genshin where I just subconsciously speed click through dialogue I actually found myself immersed in the story, not to mention I absolutely love the designs, especially Encore and Lingyang, the effects? glorious, not to mention the plots of the side quests genuinely being interesting, and actually having a skip button? I think it's good, so that way the devs can remind themselves to keep writing so well, overall I've played this game more than I have genshin.",5,2025-02-25 04:47:38

"It's a lot of fun until you reach the end of the story quest line. Then it just becomes another grind fest. Unfortunately, the storyline is rather short. üòï There are events to do, but most are too long-winded for a short game play time. Co-op is no good & I refuse to use it. The game gets boring too soon, becoming another game that just gets played for daily login rewards, taking up hard-drive space and put on the list of apps to be deleted, making room for others.",3,2025-02-25 03:17:57

"Game is exceptionally good with excellent combat system as well as pretty characters. This is the best gacha game ever, on android. However it is really not optimized for Android devices. I have 8s gen 3 and it lags. Please do optimize this game for mid range chipsets.",5,2025-02-20 09:39:33

"The game is extremely laggy on mobile to the point of being almost unplayable. On my PC it is completely fine. I recently purchased a C107 Android 14 10.1"" 128 GB tablet, and it is possible to play, but with lowered graphics, only I do not recommend this at all (it is either have it at mid-max graphics, or just don't play the game) Great game, I 100% recommend this if you are not on a mobile device, better than most Hoyo gacha games almost by far that I have played.",4,2025-02-20 08:56:20

"Overall a good game. Needs lots of QoL improvements as well as graphic polishing. The controls are bad tho. For example, the button to let go of grabbing somewhere is totally unnecessary. Also, there are many instances where some structures are not made well and characters kinda hover on them instead of climbing. Edit: the game is great but my phone can barely handle it. Needs optimization",2,2025-02-20 02:12:48
"Played since 14 feb 2025, finally entered rinascita and i lovee it!! Very grindy HAHA but honestly it gave me nostalgic genshin vibes..love the skip button too haha(not a story fan) the osts are so good too..especially loreleo vocal dancing through fantasies ost. Shorekeeper arc was kinda touching too despite me skipping most of the story lines. I hope, my love for wuthering waves never fades...",5,2025-02-20 02:12:08
I love playing this game and i have been playing this game since is release but the only thing I'm a but dissatisfied is the optimisation for low end devices like mine(it lags a lot in high settings and the only way to run it smoothly is in low settings but that destroys the fun of playing as the graphics are too low). I'd be really greatful if the developers improve the playing optimisation for low end devices.,4,2025-02-20 01:58:51

So i hope kuro update their ""lootmapper"" that can also find puzzles, challenges etc to be more efficient, so it's easy to explore and for the other players too.

Kept playing and needed to rerate. Despite not being a huge fan of the style of combat it is very fluid and works well. I just think beginning of the game is quite boring for the first few hours of the story. Plus the base characters combat is very boring. I couldn't keep playing because of this I'm sure the limited characters are more fun if you can get any I did not after playing for a couple weeks and a couple hundred summons,3,2025-02-19 23:54:25

"The game is very good, the gameplay is very smooth, but the game overall is being fixed immediately. This is really the best, there are lots of rewards, the developers are not greedy.Hong Kong developers are really kind, compared to Genshin Impact, they are generous in giving out rewards. Their echo is the first to be obtained, this is where I get the best of their main and substats, it's not difficult to grind the echo. My Poco 6x Pro is so smooth, it's no longer a potato phone. Thanks devs",5,2025-02-17 19:49:19
"AMAZING GAME. The fighting mechanics feel smooth and gratifying in terms of attacks and switching between characters mid attack. The quality is magnificent, followed by the pleasing aesthetic and coloring. Each character is unique and makes you wanna personally know more about them. The best pro about the game is the gacha system. It's SUPER easy to grind for astrites it might even take you a couple of hours to get 1600, and the pity system is fair. All in all, it's FANTASTIC",5,2025-02-17 19:43:26

Not enough settings to run smoothly on Android. Feel like it's not optimized for android. I have a MOTO G5 2024. Hav ram boosted to 8gigs.Snapdragon 4. Turned all settings down in game. Still says overloaded . Sometimes I can't play but 5mins then kicks me off. Always shuts down the game. Shame cause I love this game. What can I do?,3,2025-02-15 18:46:56

"I have played this for 4 days now. The game is intriguing, unique in its own story and interesting game mechanics that help u transverse and feel immerse in the world. But lack of optimization is what keeping most players stop playing this game. I reckon there're more mobile who can't afford a gaming pc for this so they played on their mid range phone(8gb ram I presume)even on lowest graphics, crash 3 times on every quest due to cutscene and battle transitions. Which beat GI and hsr(0 crash)",2,2025-02-15 17:06:03

"2.1. Edit: Kuro games have yet done it again. You know a company cares when they take feedback and improve on it. There has been an increase of quality of life features added within 2.1 alone. Do yourself a favour and pick this up where the company respects you as a player. Kuro games have really stepped up ever since my last review of this game. The introduction to the new characters, lands to explore, music, VA work and combat have improved significantly. Thank you! Will definitely be staying.",5,2025-02-15 15:19:57

"From all aspects, Wuthering Waves deserves to win awards, it's just that the gacha system is too unlucky which makes this game have to spend a lot of money.

"I used to enjoy playing the game. I am at union level 80 and i have almost all the characters. I did all the maps 100%, i did all the missions but i deleted the game today. Because i can't stand it anymore. The game constantly makes you solve stupid puzzles. More stupid puzzles with every update. They add new regions like a maze with every update, i couldn't stand it anymore. It has a great combat system but the map design is garbage.",2,2025-02-13 12:28:01

The game it self is really good But there's a problem that genshin doesn't have When I update the game I need to download the hole data game again while in genshin you just download the data one time and after that you just download the update patch which is like 3_4gb Now when I updated this game to versione 2.1 i need to download 19 gb in the game Idk if that's a problem I just had or it's like that for everyone And the game sometimes crash too.üòï,4,2025-02-13 12:11:58

"Wuthering Waves is an amazing game with stunning graphics, exciting gameplay, and a deep storyline. However, there's one major issue‚Äîhuge update sizes. For us in the Arab world, downloading such large updates can be really difficult due to slow internet speeds and data limitations. I hope the developers take this into consideration and optimize future updates to be smaller, especially for mobile players. Reducing update sizes will make the game more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.",4,2025-02-13 06:08:39
"The game is everything I wanted it to be but better, it exceeded my expectations way beyond I though it'd be possible and the care and generosity of the devs certainly make the players wanting to keep playing more, the plot and soundtrack are just amazing, and keeps getting better at every update, Love you Kuro games, keep doing this amazing work of yours as always :3",5,2025-02-13 06:08:17

Fun minigames around the map. Beautiful world that's free to roam - it's HUGE - with no loading screens or anything. Very responsive app with little time between fast travels or loading it up.

"I play in both PC and Mobile and have been playing back when this game was 1.0 and with bugs. Pros: Every single character is unique and if built right, is powerful and fun to play Each and every voice acting sounds great and animations smooth. Combat itself is very entertaining and as u find harder enemies, the combat feels challenging World building is different, as Rinasita lives upto the rep of land of echoes. Flight was added to Rinasita only and for good reason, making exploration easy",5,2025-02-12 08:52:07
The game itself is VERY fun i am enjoying it so much and since it's a new game i can see a lot of room for improvements and considering that the game is not that old yet you can expect some lagging from here and there like what i'm experiencing but it's tolerable for me but for now i'll rate 4‚≠êÔ∏è~,5,2025-02-12 07:49:31

"Gathering Wives. What a shame. I thought this will change the face of gacha. Baiting us male wanters on the initial release then not releasing male again? Xiangli Yao is not technically counted because he's free, so 1 limited male on version 1.x then only Brant on 2.x. How about advertised it as a waifu game instead? The community targeting us to quit because of simply wanting a male charas? So it's our fault now that its a game that initially cater and advertised for both gender? I'll quit.",1,2025-02-12 06:15:10

"I want to start the game fresh as a returning player. It takes 30 days to use same email. Story ch 1 is long and forgettable. 2.0 is a breath of fresh air but seems to end abrupt. Game play is fun / exploring. Echoxp is non-existent. Too many xp currencies, including the ""mora"" which becomes a bottle neck once you hit 70+ as a new player. Tldr: Worth a play In good honesty, my review went up from 1star but I can't give Kuro 5 stars when there is many flaws. I didnt even mention ToA engame.",3,2025-02-12 03:28:18
"An absolute good fantastic game tbh At first I just thought it would be another open world game but in reality it surprised me a lot like the most fascinating thing was the combat mechanics like it's absolutely so good like being able to dodge, parry and all . While in a boss fight the excitement ragens like when you're fighting a very hard boss it depends on your skills unlike in many other games where it depends solely on the characters stats and all that But in wuwa it depends on skills",5,2025-02-12 02:40:38

The quality provided by the developers and how they act towards their players and making the game optimised for their players is something too good and awsome stuff.

The game is very good in terms of story and exploration but the optimisation makes it really difficult to enjoy I have a high mid-range device but it still lags like anything and after the 1.3 update it became worse and crashed again and again the devs really need to work on the optimisation for Android the core mechanics like comback is just a nightmare I don't like the fact that the this game with so much potential is getting hold back because of poor optimisation people will start to quit,5,2025-02-09 18:53:39

It really is a low move from the devs. I don't like FOMO or lore locked in limited events. I would be ok with limited rewards, but locking lore is crazy.",3,2025-02-09 12:09:26

"Quite frankly, an amazing game. Beautiful art, and fun gameplay. Overtime it's gotten better, definitely one of the best gacha rpg's out there. Very deserving of 5 stars.",5,2025-02-09 11:31:26
the game in itself may not be all shiny and that much attractive from the outer view but as you start involving yourself in the lore and gameplay you definitely will start enjoying it. One very major impression of my rating comes from the performance of their devs. The developers are very very understanding and implement almost every idea the community talks about at some point. The bugs are fixed properly and on time.,5,2025-02-09 11:25:31

The breathtaking graphics and unique game mechanics make it all the more fun to explore. I like how you can use skill and strategies defeat enemies rather than just using op characters as it makes the game more fun and interesting to play.

The gacha system is also a bit lineant for f2p bevause the rewards that this game provides is very very good. The story is above average so far, character models are one of the most detailed ones I have seen in a gacha game, the abilities and fights are unique for every enemy and character, it makes the game truly the greatest gacha game imo.

Absolute cinema. I've been playing since launch and man i do not regret one second of me playing it.

"Grinded as hard as I could to hit pity before a character left banner. But for some abysmal reason your account starts at 50/50 instead of guarantee, so I lost 50/50 and have no way in hell of getting the character now. So I cut my losses and uninstalled. It doesn't help the standard 5 stars in this game are insanely boring. Logic would dictate you give the player their first 5 star they are trying to get so the player sticks around. Guess whoever designed this game missed the memo.",2,2025-02-09 03:29:38
Honestly it's bland. The visuals are good but the system requirements are very high with poor configuration options for lower end devices. After a while I got used to the visual quality and then it turns to not that much of a plus point. I enjoyed some of the companion and exploration quests but the main and side quests aren't that great. The events are mostly decent. Too much resources needed to fully build a character results in monotonous grinding. Great combat but wrost relic system.,3,2025-02-09 02:46:41

What I am disappointed about, however, is the lack of male characters in the game after having been advertised as a game with a good male:female ratio.

"Wuthering Waves is an exciting open-world RPG with a deep story, smooth combat, and fun traversal mechanics. The game offers dynamic movement, including sprinting, wall-running, and a grappling hook, making exploration enjoyable. The combat system is fast-paced and skill-based, with unique character abilities and combo-based attacks. Despite this, Wuthering Waves has great potential.

"It's a good game in early phases. The levels of the characters don't matter, as the enemies start to give massive damage and become very challenging. You need real strategy and lot of time to effectively beat the mini-bosses. It lags sometimes during battles. Currently it's IMPROVED a LOT. Many new features, characters and story has again made it rise. The MAIN PROBLEM is, there is LACK of tutorials on counterattacking and dodges for different varieties of bosses.",5,2025-02-06 00:11:47

"I'm updating my review from 1 star to reflect the improvements made. The recent updates have truly enhanced the game, making it much smoother and more enjoyable. The animations and graphics are impressive, and the lip sync is spot on. I initially struggled to play because of significant bugs, stuttering, and freezing, which was really frustrating. Thankfully, those issues seem to have been resolved, and I can finally enjoy the game again. Thank you to the developers for your hard work in makin",5,2025-02-03 06:54:38

"The game itself is amazing, open world, great combat with a fun dodge/parry system. 2.0 update is probably the best update of all of gatcha gaming. But the gatcha rates are terrible. Although the rates are way better than genahin, it still In average needs about 65-70 per legendary pull. When $100 only gives 40 pulls, this adds up very fast.

"As new player, be prepared to either slog thru whole first year + of content before you can experience any latest event. (Or skip it, it was darn bad). Get your favourite character and build them early while the banner is up, otherwise you'll need to repeat the first paragraph to unlock any mats needed for the charact. Combat animation and exploration is amazing, but otherwise gets boring cos my Camellya is stuck at lvl40 and I'm stuck with 3 other chars since start to be able to clear anything",3,2025-02-01 22:03:43
"Absolutely GREAT GAME! The combat is nice and the character designs are actually very detailed which I didn't expect. Even though the gameplay is good, the performance for low-end devices could use some optimization. My fps usually drops when I'm using my phones data (which I don't know why?) and runs okay-ish when I connect to my wifi. Still though, the cutscenes, the combat, the generous developers, everything is GREAT! In my opinion, this should be everyone's first RPG game. Well done devs!",5,2025-02-01 22:02:47

Played both wuwa and pgr since their release and this one was the most entertaining. Though even in the lowest settings the game inputs feel delayed and the movement is quite sensitive.

"Just a better genshun impact in every way. The main stories, events and characters are all far more interesting. The sidequests (that are sometimes admittedly wordy and boring) are all skippable, and environment traversal is extremely quick and fun. Combat is difficult but not unfair, and the feeling of dodging an opponents attack is always a satisfying dopamine rush. Weapon banners are guaranteed. Just an absolute triumph in the gacha space.",5,2025-01-30 12:49:18

I think this has been one of the best battle plays I've experienced. I love the custom keys element too. The events are quite interesting, introduces some Chinese cultural festivities, which is quite heartwarming.

"This is by far the most polished gacha game I have played, especially starting from black shores story and onwards. What Wuwa is doing should be a wakeup call for other gacha games, with the Rinascita update, this game feels more like a triple a studio game than some actual 3A titles (such as assassin' creed).

The devs are listening to the community and are implementing QoL tools in the game but not compromising the difficulty and fun. There's lot to do but not too much time-consuming.

"This game really needs optimization on mobile, it does not look good even on the highest settings compared to its PC version and other gacha games on mobile. The game also needs to an update to its echo farming because right now it's really not efficient and such a nightmare to farm for a specific dmg bonus and getting the wrong echo set. A more cleaner and polished UI is also required. These are my complaints but overall the game is really good with some of the best combat.",4,2025-01-25 22:11:11

"Yet another brilliant gatcha. Amazing combat, characters, QoL, gameplay and story. However only bad is the comparison with other and the optimization on Android. I have no problem with PC though.

As the game develops character attacks are becoming more flashy with a ton of special effect making it almost impossible to play on mobile and making the core mechanic of dodging practically impossible and ruined the game for me. The new boss enemies also have access to ridiculously difficult to deal with attacks and literal one shot attacks that have no seeming way to dodge,1,2025-01-25 05:15:13

Game is really good and feels better than Genshin. The game is really generous but some FTP players have better items and characters then people who pay since they just grind all day... I started to see ftp players use less pull and have S2 chain on Shore Keeper and weapon despite not spending. So the conclusion is don't spend money on this game since there is no content for whales and mid spenders accounts will usually be worse then a FTP grinder so just buy BP and log in pass.

After I install the game, nothing pops up when it loads, as in the music is just running with the background there. No words, nothing. Other than technical issues, it's a really nice game.

Absolutely no data compression, and zero attempts made to streamline the coding. This is, so far, the pinnacle example of this sort of laziness overwhelming the game design world.

Ex Genshin Player here. Was tired of Hoyoverse's BS in Genshin what with lack of endgame and grindiness of artifacts so tried out Wuwa. The Traversal is AMAZING especially not running out of stamina and the Grappling hook. The Artifact system (echoes) are just as grindy but at least manageable compared to Genshin. Also Kuro Games far more responsive and accommodating then Hoyoverse which is always a treat! luving the game so far but the male/female ratio is getting stretched thin by each patch.,4,2025-01-24 20:13:00

I feel it's ruining my phone, I played a lot of games that has more space than this one (WuWa got 20gb) and never happened to me like that! Also, when I play some. Quests, it laggs when I fight!!

"Just like every other gotcha. Don't be fooled. Sure they give free stuff out all the time, but the wishing system is just as preditory as Genshin. If your a male you have worse wishes, and if you play often or spend money guess what worse wishes. They do this behind the scene just like maple story. There is a patent for this so it's true.

Connectivity issues have been stabilized so you don't get these warnings mid fight, the mini games are going well when the character collects the items within the hit detection box, which makes the mini games easy to one shot in one go instead of repeating them to collect missed items. The Rinascita update is an absolute gem, which funnily enough, means rebirth in Italian, meaning the rebirth of this game to reaching new heights. GJ!",5,2025-01-23 19:04:36

Hope they will fix that as well. Oh also the game is more pleasant if you're either male or only like female characters. Lovely fan service, for men.",2,2025-01-23 03:43:23

The story quests start out a bit slow, but you can tell where the writers hit their stride because the cutscene animation and story pacing really start to hook near the end of Part 1. Fun action and beautiful game. Also on PS5, nice.",5,2025-01-22 02:32:46

"This game is honestly amazing, good storyline, good character designs and the gameplay is very nice but it's super laggy to the point I can't play it. I've tried deleting other apps which worked for a little while but now anytime I want to play the loading screen doesn't even get past 75% and that's incredibly frustrating because I cannot continue the new update. I'm hoping this gets fixed in the future",3,2025-01-21 22:31:28
"Game first , Gacha second I started a month ago,completed all of the main/side quests, working on exploration quests and 100% exploring the regions and unlocking their collectibles. The best combat and exploration to its competitors easily.

"I truly love the game. Firstly, I love the story. I know that not everyone love the story but I personally love it very much (I litteraly want to write a review because of this). When you look from MC's POV, when you litteraly was dumped to an unkown world where you don't know anything or anyone & you don't know the darkness of humans, I think the MC did very great in navigating their surroundings. Secondly, I REALLY LOVE the music! I look forward to future updates, especially to the main story!",5,2025-01-21 13:56:31

"When the game was initially launched I didn't like it much for reasons like no optimised gameplay , lot of bugs , poor VA and so on. I decided to play the game after 1.5 and oh my god it has been a blast and I've been enjoying everything in this game , the gameplay is more optimised , specially in mobile devices now , the VA in 2.0 is absolutely goated and the developers are actually listening to the feedbacks . Absolutely loving it .",5,2025-01-21 11:35:46
"Definitely one of the best ever. The fast paced action where I can skip and actually start where I WANT to start, the exploration is just TEN times better, its amazing how much content it has for game that came out a year ago. The combat feels a little bit like PGR(Punishing Gray Rayven) in short I love the combat system the parry, dodge, but I'm not a fan of how difficult to level up your Gord where you have to collect echoes to level up. But despite that the Eng VA just seems a bit of a meh.",5,2025-01-21 10:58:05
"The game is good unless you have the bare minimum requirements for your device, the game used to run well but became a lot more laggy. The devs haven't really fix the issue but I don't think it's getting fix anyways. Run the game at your own risk.",5,2025-01-21 10:57:47

"Game has improved dramatically in 2.0. Brand new map, new Echoes, bosses, great story & fantastic music. Rinascita's map is a joy to traverse with the new glide wing mechanic, or with the gondolas. Despite its many improvements, I still only play on mobile if I have no other choice. This game is just made for phones that don't exist yet. The loss of graphical fidelity & playability is too much for me, even with recent optimizations.",4,2025-01-20 23:20:47
"Honestly I started this game about a month ago, sped ran my first account and restarted because of how good the story and animations were, characters are all very unique and interesting, lots of free rewards you can gain by ""grinding"" but this is one game it doesn't really feel like a grind because every fight is different. Really love the open combat design instead of turn based, true RPG, and you will not be disappointed.",5,2025-01-20 23:01:27

I think mobile needs a bit more love, I'll continue to play once I get a console or laptop. I'm not the only one in my house who's noticed that, and I play on a decent phone with 8gb of ram so I can play it just fine, that's not an issue.",4,2025-01-20 22:09:58

"Great Story but it's a gacha. After completing everything I'm around union lv 48. There's absolutely nothing but echo farming to do and co-op hardly exist. Pulled for new resonator (got 1 yay), out of my time playing haven't seen the new unit but I have maxed out Chixia, Mortifi & Sanhua, all F2P mind you. Yet the drop rates says it's higher chance rate. That's obviously a LIE.

"Wuthering Waves is really comparable to Genshin Impact. Although, I like the gameplay of Wuthering Waves than the latter. Hence, it is much easier to grind and get the resonators that you want. What seems to be lacking is the map itself. Thus, it would be great if the mods could be able to add more stories and land for users to explore. Overall, the app is commendable and I would definitely continue playing this game. This game certainly deserves a 5-Star rating.",5,2025-01-20 01:57:16

Definitely one of the better games made this past few years. Its not p2w and actually gives a lot of free stuff. The only bad side would is that the story does have it's inconsistencies and it definitely needs more optimization.,5,2025-01-19 05:59:22

"So I finally returned after quitting in 1.0, I have to say the game is near perfection, graphics characters, exploration, combat, gameplay and performance has improved massively and i mean tremendously, my biggest and only standing issue now is how absolutely atrocious it is to grind echos, I'm sorry but walking around killing hundreds of echos every day only to get garbage is dreadful and i mean literally pain inducing, echo farming needs a huge revamp so it's not so horrible and grindy.",3,2025-01-19 03:01:52

"Rating after 1.3 and the story is absolute cinema. World exploration and puzzles are fun, but combat..... It's FIREE..... Awesome visuals, parry, dodge-counter and a lot more. One of the best game I've ever played. Edit after 2.0- QoL updates are insane, new flight utility is mind blowing and the new region... PEAK. Still at the top among all gacha games.",5,2025-01-19 00:57:49

"This is maybe the third time installing this game since it came out, only to be blocked by something not working. They finally added controller support so I installed it again, only to find there's no option to invert the y-axis. I'm not even going to try getting used to that in an action game. I give up on this game entirely.",4,2025-01-19 00:36:31

The gender ratio of each banners is too justified for specific target (iykwim). Interractions between chars towards MC are too glazed and biased. Need some morally grey playable characters and more realistic approach to MC. Gameplay is fun but those story factors are the reason im not invested to this game. Good luck fixing them.,2,2025-01-18 11:00:50

"Wuthering Waves is fantastic! The game immerses players with stunning visuals, captivating scenes, and an open-world environment. Thrilling combat, an engaging story, and impressive mechanics make each encounter unique and challenging. The puzzles are thought-provoking, and the English localization is excellent.

"Tbh, I love this game so much. Safe to say tht this is my favourite out of all the RPG games I've tried. I love the storyline, the characters' lore & etc. Though, theres also stuffs tht annoys me. For example, how the screen suddenly went all black, when the enemy thts supposed to be defeated was revived,when the texts didnt appear like its supposed to, or maybe when the language and texts suddenly changes itself to Chinese when I didn't even do anything. But overall, its a good F2P RPG game <3",5,2025-01-17 00:34:33

This roughness is such an eyesore to look at during long session. If it wasn't for this, this game deserves more than 5 stars",3,2025-01-14 19:24:12

"I really like your game but there is one problem. You see, I just got Carlotta and I kinda disappointed about her skill because I don't know If is just me or someone have the same problem because when I use her skill it didn't hit the enemy like she rather avoid hitting the enemy like why bro??....can you tell me what to do?",4,2025-01-14 18:40:09

Devs actually listen to feedback as Rinascita 2.0 was a huge improvement from 1.0. Only criticism I have is story is a bit too easy so Tower of adversity challenge might be a huge skill check. Story should have harder soulslike bosses.",5,2025-01-14 13:21:59

"Been a fan since the beta, I'm so proud of how far we've come, I'm so so excited to play this game. Currently the game is very smooth, it's indeed my device which is perhaps getting too old, but even so my love for this game keeps winning me back to keep trying to play the game even in my smol fried phone. Thank you very much! Keep up the good work kuro!! I'll keep playing pgr for now and play wuwa in this phone, in the future hoping I can also play this game with good graphics soon üíûüíï",5,2025-01-12 18:43:53

"At this point I'm not sure if it's me or my phone, despite this supposedly being compatible with my device. But this game crashed every 30 seconds, and I could barely even get through the tutorial. It managed to run ""okay"", albeit laggy (had to be really REALLY slow on how I moved my character otherwise it would've crashed), on my really old, broken outdated phone, but not a Nokia G310 5G I bought a few months ago.. I was even playing on every lowest setting possible and it still can't do it.",1,2025-01-12 16:05:59

"I love the world and the fighting mechanics, but the story always goes the ""cringey isekai harem"" route, and it gets in the way of an otherwise really interesting plotline and just ruins it for me.

This game requires a very, very high performing phone to load, I personally use a mid-phone, and every time I play this game, even at the loading screen, it lags so much, even if it's in-game, and I even set the graphics to the lowest, it's still the same, LAG. It was great at first when it was released, and then suddenly, it became so laggy that I did not even want to log in anymore.

"Left a couple patches before 2.0 because the performance on my phone was unbearable. I came back recently to find that the performance had somewhat improved and the loading times reduced, so I am really happy about that. On the other hand, the other main reason why I left a while ago was because of the poor localization, unfortunately this issue has still not been resolved up to this day.

Combat is pretty fun but there's too many rerun banners for how few characters are in the game. Furthermore the rates as a ftp player feel kinda awful.

"500 characters isn't enough to accurate described the issue in this game so I'll keep it short. Story's is poorly thought through, Lack of Intresting characters and they all got repetitive dialogues. Dull and Dreary environment aswell which isn't bad but it's not great when you lack many intrest points already. Best thing to this game is it's combat mechanics and opened world feel if you want more your waiting for it.

I really love this game. I didnt think that the game would run this smoothly on my phone. When I played PGR on my 3gb ram phone I was surprised when that run smoothly. But as this is a open world game I didnt think that it would run this smoothly. And after playing the first chapter I think I'll play this till my phone explodes Update: Still at 5 star baby!!! No other gacha game made me glaze at an update except Wuwa. Love the 2.0. Would've glazed it more if not for the 500 word limit. Kep it up,5,2025-01-10 23:54:52

"1* because it won't even let me download the files needed. Says it needs 9.4 gigs of storage and to delete files and try again, but I have almost 14 gigs of storage space free. If and only IF this can get fixed, so I can actually try the game, will I change my rating. Edit: 5 months later; I get no assistance, no change, no one trying to reach out to talk to me. Obviously they don't care about their players. Thanks for making me hate a game I can't even play.",1,2025-01-10 23:20:45

My only complain is the storage is too high for mobile and despite it being in the lowest graphics set it still looks quite high and if it's actually on high graphics it looks blurry. Another thing is it keeps updating which i understand but the storage is getting too much. also why is it so hard to walk in the game,5,2025-01-10 21:38:37

The flying mechanic are an absolute HUGE improvement! & Rinascita are gorgeous, by far this game personally feels like a AAA game and to be able to play it for free feels illegal because of how amazing this game is. Music:12/10, QoL:9/10, Story 9/10, Rinascita world;10/10. NPC;8/10. ENG VA;9/10. Masterpiece!",5,2025-01-10 11:28:03

Whenever I zoom out more than 80% in the open world, the details on the character turned less detailed and looks goofy. I found an issue with Changli's right arm. there's AN empty void line on her right shoulder until reaches her right sideboob(only in the open world) Lastly, I wish part of the clothes that merged with the character's skin is more detailed and less jagged especially on highest graphics.",4,2025-01-10 10:17:52

Not every device is the same, not even every phone is the same even in same model, sometimes you loose the silicon lottery and get more errors and instability. Sometimes it is the game's fault, but not always. You can clear TOA as F2P with 4* units Loosing 50/50 is luck issue, there are plenty of resources to get the chars you want either way Kuro is mid sized studio, that made a hit, let them grow.

"Great game, I've enjoyed exploring all regions especially the latest ""Rinascita"", totally addicted with the new flying utility it helps a lot going high grounds and traverse landscapes etc. Devs also values and listens to people making game improvements and players life easier. Totally loved it.",5,2025-01-09 15:58:20
"I don't often play Gacha games whatsoever but I decided to give Wuwa a try and I must say I am not disappointed in the slightest, everything about the game screams ""Love"" this is the type of game that I can play all day without ever getting bored and that is a very hard thing to achieve nowadays, the characters are amazing, the fighting and animations are amazing, everything besides the story is top notch but let's be real, 70% of the community is looking for clean fights. 10/10 game.",5,2025-01-09 15:45:04

Better than Genshin Impact in production and character identification. This game also has better rewards. Genshin has been mistreating their player base while Wuthering waves showers their players in rewards. Very good game.,5,2025-01-09 11:44:34

BETTER THAN GENSHIN,5,2025-01-09 09:17:16
So I enjoyed this game and was looking forward to PS5 release because I'm not a mobile gamer. But my main problem is how restricted it is for account linking and choosing the region. I brought my PS5 in Korea but because my address and method of payment at the time I had when I brought my PS5 5 years ago it has it hardlocked to America thus I can't enjoy this game if I can't keep my progress and characters. I don't like people who cheat the system but this security is overkill.,1,2025-01-09 08:49:22
rinascita has been amazing. Absolute cinema. The flying is an amazing feature and i hope it somehow will become available for the other regions other than rinascita. So much QoL with the devs constantly listening. Such passion from the devs warrants love from the players as well. It's nice to be treated well and fair.,5,2025-01-09 08:36:34
"AMAZING GAMEPLAY, no seriously I love everything about this game genuinely.

"To say I had an horrendous experience with this game is an understatement. From launch relentless lagging , frequent crashes even when I don't open the game even now game will not start at all anymore , camera is a disaster , missions can be uncompletable due to delays in obstacles appearing and inputs and random connection cuts just by moving slightly making fights and traversal near impossible as well.

"Super good game. Plays well, rewarded when learning mechanics. Very beautiful style for the scenery and the characters. Characters have a wide range of aesthetics, many fall into 'cool and pretty' category. More F2p friendly over its competitors. End game exists, but it is definitely completable. 2.0 update provided an update to end game along with the new area. Can't recommend this game more.",5,2025-01-08 04:59:22

There are a ton of new echo's to grind as well as new echo sets. A new character which I found to be very enjoyable. A new gadget which is so much fun to use in traversal that I do not even use waypoints anymore. And so, so much more but this review has a 500 icon limit.",5,2025-01-07 21:01:02

"Great game, great character design, great, difficult but enjoyable gameplay (but really difficult for me because it crashes often especially in mount firment and I'm on mobile). The skip button is especially game changing for me because it let's me skip cutscenes for small missions/ quests. Doesn't have character synergy which is great you don't need to pull for another character to make your current ones work, which makes team comps easy. (just put your favorite characters and your done).",4,2025-01-07 16:34:50

Best game but still it's not for a mobile device. It still cannot run at max settings for many 8gb devices . Its only optimized for laptops and pc with 4gb vram. I think in future the game should be optimized.,5,2025-01-06 18:15:05

This game is good than geshin but everything has its pros and cons and it's hard for me to understand how things work in this game that's my fault but I love playing this game but recently I have seen the game shuting down automatically I don't know what went wrong I checked and I thought my phones problem but if I opened playstore and checked after almost ready to reset my phone there shows an update please show in game to update please,5,2025-01-06 17:48:25

"The 2.0 Rinnacita update is phenomenal. There is no better time than now to get into the story of Wuthering Waves. The music is amazing, the voice acting is fantastic, and the new characters are so lovely and memorable! The cinematic cutscenes are so cool and engaging I can't ask for anything more from them. KURO Games really knocked it out of the park with this update. I didn't skip a single cutscene the story was so interesting. Great job",5,2025-01-06 17:37:51
"One thing I could say, ""Continue on improving the game"". And I hope that this game will last for many years, and keeps the quality unchanged or improve the quality as the game goes on.

I haven't been playing on the app because my phone can't handle the requirements of the game. Now I'm currently using a cloud gaming service. My only recommendation is please make a Wuthering Waves cloud like other games so that we can still play this on our own devices without the sketchy cloudgaming services. I know you guys are on 6 months on this space and it might take too long but it will be worth the wait. The 2.0 update is really really good.

"It would get 5 stars if it had character creation, or atleast allow you to fully customize the main characters you choose from. I'm not a fan of switching characters out just to change elements, damage types/classes. I love the way ToF did it.

Those are my only 2 issues. It needs character creation.",3,2025-01-06 06:07:53

The gacha is of course like other games but I feel like I don't need to pull for every character as my team works perfectly well. I just need a reroll of Jiyan now.",5,2025-01-05 19:25:39

"Game is great I love it, and can't wait for 2.0 but I am still struggling with the game freezeing from my phone getting over loaded and then shuting down on its own.

"the 2.0 update doesnt change my review, in fact i wanted to improve it if i could!! its by far, the PEAK storytelling for this game. and technicality wise, even with a really large map expansion, the game barely increased its size. and for performance, its also amazing. it somehow runs on a 4 year old mid-range phone (Redmi Note 9 Pro), despite it being under the minimum required specs. of course it was for testing only, but it shows the performance improvements after version 1.0. impressive!",5,2025-01-05 17:41:29

"Updating since launch: it's just Genshin BUT SO MUCH BETTER. The biggest advantage is that this game doesn't disrespect me or my time - it actually allows me to not care about it's story and let's me skip its numerous cutscenes unlike Genshin. It looks way better, has far deeper combat, and streamlines a lot of trash that Genshin (and Star Rail) doesn't. My biggest gripe is that this game also censors like crazy. And in no sensible way. None of it is grounded in any logic. Knock it off already.",4,2025-01-04 21:25:51
"This game deserves a 5 stat rating, but not the optimisation. All other similar games, like ZZZ or Tower of Fantasy, run pretty smoothly on my newly bought tablet, but not Wuthering Waves.

On Playstation you cannot change the server from the one they have picked for you. So if you play on a different server to where your account is you cannot play.

They release almost no male characters and cater to losers who hate male characters. They dont care about the game and try to pump out coomerbait to make quick money.

Also, the rewards are great, it's very easy not to spend money just for some pulls, f2p friendly indeed. Also, there's this weird thing I saw in the game, I think it's not supposed to be like that, nothing major, just the text is weird.

Ok I'm editing my post to let people know this is a pretty device heavy game requiring 8gb of ram just to be somewhat not laggy which still isn't good and still has crashes and lags bad constantly the game is very fun and pretty f2p with good devs but the only phones I know of other than maybe some random top of the line good phones that run 8gb of ram are the iPhones 14 max pro and above which are extremely expensive phones and this game most likely can't be run on a laptop unless it is decent.,3,2025-01-03 10:40:15

All out my favorite RPG games I've played. But in the recent update. Where new Resonator came out. An update happen. It was 17.5 GB. Quite shocking. But I still updated it. But to my surprise. My Account is gone. All of my hard work is gone. Countless spent on this game just vanished. It showed that I need to create a new account. Put me to shame that this game just made me lose interest. Can you fix it? If you did. I'll gladly play it back.,4,2025-01-02 18:16:20

"The first part of the story was a bit boring, but there's a skip button so you can skip the storyline and its controller compatible (I use one for PS4). All of their characters are good, even the ones given in the beginning. The weapons and characters have separate banners with the weapon banners having a guarantee 5* drop.

The music is above average, the story is good enough so far, and most importantly there is a dialog skip button! Daily missions can't be autoed but take maybe 5 minutes.

This game is a poor version of genshin impact i swear everything is a scam. The character icon is stolen and the chat icon also stolen the skills some characters like gaming and yea miko and nahida and some other characters the map icon also stolen every freaking thing is stolen hell nah man only scams play this thing.i tried it and its first poor quality second the jumping is weird third even the quests are stolen. Just go he'll and make a game of yourself duuhhh,1,2025-01-01 16:10:01

"I have to be honest and say the entire vibe of the game disappoints me. Everything from the jinzhou to the Blackshore, none of them were good enough to have me interested in the environment, the story, the characters. I love pgr so it isn't about disliking dark, it just looks so uninspired and dead. Awaiting the next region tho. 2 stars for combat. 1 other star for keeping me more entertained than genshin at least.",3,2025-01-01 15:46:10
"It's a gacha game that I thought would be the same with every other game, but turned out to exceed my expectations. Now it's the only gacha game I play. If you love good combat, complex mechanics, and skill-based content, play this game. Even if you don't like complex stuff and just want to chill, wuthering waves also has something for you. The game has something for everyone to enjoy.",5,2025-01-01 15:36:01
"The first worthy successor to Genshin Impact. In fact much of the game is ""inspired"" from GI. It does many things differently but many things are also similar. So if you're a Genshin player then you'll jump right into this game. If not, it'll take a little while.",5,2025-01-01 15:19:22

Why your updates are not pre downloadable on mobile devices? If You guys can add that feature on pc why not mobile too.? Not everyone have wifi. Downloading 12 gb update in one go is not possible for everyone. And WuWa has very good combat machanics and Bosses but how to enjoy it with 300 ms? Why only region based servers. Why can't we have County level East West North south servers just like all moba and fighting fps games have.,3,2025-01-01 11:29:29
I originally thought it was a cheap copy of genshin but after playing for a while I found it is different from genshin and I really love it. So if you are searching for more f2p friendly game then this game is best for you. And also these days many do wuws vs genshin for them I would say : I LOVE BOTH GAMES EQUALLY,5,2025-01-01 11:25:12

"So you guys actually listened and added controller support that's great it makes the playthrough on mobile better, still...I now have another problem. Over the past few months with the updates you guys have been releasing, the game just kept getting better and better performance wise in my phone. Somehow the little performance problems I was experiencing in the past few days stopped, I don't even know how. The constant lags and crashing just stopped hope it stays that way",5,2025-01-01 10:08:34

"Speaking from a Realme 10 device(G99), the game itself is beautiful, character designs are top tier as always by Kuro. Combat is nice and so far the story is okay-ish but it's been improving so far. For the optimization which is the only complain I have in the game, it's improved since at launch but open world combat is so far has the most stutters. Exploration often felt smooth with little to no stutters. The most smooth experience I could get from the game is when you are in enclosed space.",5,2025-01-01 06:20:04

"The dev team alone is worth a high rating. You can truly see how they love and wish to further improve for their players. The past updates have been QoL and soon we are getting even more mechanics to expand upon. The combat is versatile. Character designs are beautiful. Environment is lovely. The story may feel cliche however it is a popular trope over seas. Kuro is only just beginning, therefore the patience is worth. Nothing feels too grind-y. I love the Bellborne turtle boss.

"Wuthering waves is a wonderful open world game. It's a game I spent several months with and a game I invested in quite a lot, over these past seven months. However, there's one thing that just doesn't sit well with me . The game renders too much. Even the slightest movement makes the game renders trees, grass etc. I wish the devs would add an option that could make mobile players turn off some of these intense features such as the render distance, and swaying grass.",3,2024-12-30 20:23:32

"Great game and very f2p friendly. As f2p you're not gonna get every single character probably, but it has a good pity system in place so you can guarantee a character that you really want. It does take a bit to save up though. And while it has a lot of content at the beginning, and a ton of events, eventually it does kinda dry up and there's not much else to do. So you have to wait for new events. Dailies can be done in 5 minutes, which is awesome, but would be nice if there was more endgame.",4,2024-12-30 06:12:31

"this is honestly one of the least oppressive gacha games I've played. the store can't be found on the main screen, there's not a lot to buy from the store (might be a downside for whales?) and there is no store pop-ups when you login or any other time. the game is fun to play, but it's that noteworthy a solid game isn't shoving the cash shop down your throat. it's become my main mobile game",5,2024-12-28 01:05:32
"Wuthering Waves is an amazing game! The graphics are stunning, the story is really interesting, and the gameplay is super fun. I love how smooth the combat feels and how much there is to explore.

"I'm personally a big Wuthering Waves fan, I really love how the game as a whole is fast paced and difficult, it sets a challenge to the player. However, Gameplay aside, Wuwa has had a problem with the story, Rover as of right now is seen as though he is a God, he's constantly seen as a romantic interest for many of the characters despite it not being the case. Fan service in this game is extreme, You'd expect this game to be 17+ for it's outrageous amount of suggestive content",3,2024-12-27 20:23:01

Love it!!",5,2024-12-27 09:06:32
"I 100% love the game, but i really wish they optimized it for mobile users, and maybe even a setting option where we can turn off the character attack effects (if there isn't one already) because I have a HUGE problem of only being able to take 20% of a boss' ho before my game crashes, and it makes me worried about being able to farm for ascension materials.

"Pretty solid game. The points I really appreciate are: 1. Players in-game feedback is actually being taking into account for future QoL additions. 2. I don't feel that the decisions maked by the higher-ups are as scamy as posible. 3. Actually feels there's effort put into the game. 4. Absence of questionable decisions that objectively make the game experience worse unless you get X. X being something devs added to sell you a solution.

"Good but still has some issues. Namely when farming for echoes to boost a characters element, you typically want the echoes that give a flat elemental boost along with it's echo-set boost. Why is there a chance for the flat boost to be another element like ice, when the set is for electric? Every character only has ONE element. A half & half mix like that doesn't help to properly strengthen any of those elements. All it does is make the grinding more of a slog to go through. Still needs updating",3,2024-12-20 12:47:04

I want to rate it higher. I enjoy the game but the gameplay favors elitist gamers. If you aren't typically the top 10% of gamers don't waste your time. I get tired of playing great games only to realize the devs favored masochistic tendencies over letting you have fun. Automatically raising the world level without warning instead of letting you raise it for more of a challenge yourself is exactly the mindset you are playing against and it doesn't feel good in single player worlds.,4,2024-12-17 07:07:55

"The game impresses right from the start with its breathtaking graphics and immersive world design. The attention to detail in character models, environments, and lighting is truly remarkable, making the gameplay feel cinematic and visually stunning. Adding to this is the story, which is engaging, emotionally resonant, and filled with twists that keep you hooked from the get-go. However, the experience takes a significant hit due to persistent high ping issues. The gameplay often feels sluggish,",3,2024-12-16 19:50:58

"I really tried to put up with this game but sadly it has become one of the worst mobile gaming experience I ever had. Sure the devs are generous with rewards but it will be useless if the game is unplayable due to poor performance. The high ping issue is insane, mine goes from 50 to 999ms in a snap specially once I engage in combat. It doesnt make sense since I'm using high end gaming phone.

I appreciate Kuro Games staffs for their hardworks on the game, I know y'all must be tired on improving the game for our enjoyment. The game has been improved since the release.

"I've played since day one and quite enjoyed it until the gender ratio started to skew in an unfavorable direction. Male characters were already neglected from the start as the female characters were favored. The designs, physics and ultimates of the female characters were sexualized in a way that male characters were never going to be. All the male characters are just bait, meant to keep their audience around for longer in hopes to profit but not investing long-term.",1,2024-12-14 03:11:41

Perfect. Just keep doing what you're doing devs. We love it. Genshin ain't got sh... On you,5,2024-12-14 01:42:08
"Using loads of Chinese mythology and sci-fi elements, as well as a much more overt experience with the lore, the less reading the better, it's crafted a story that treats it's audience with maturity and values their time, the characters are very lively and the environment very immersive. I think the game does need more variety in terms of character designs to make them a little more distinct, the body types are different enough but would love to see more variety in weight, age and ethnicities.",5,2024-12-14 01:25:31
"Terrible connection, that's it, i cannot connect with wifi, then a message popped out ""gateway connection timeout"" like, I don't know what that mean, player weren't supposed to know or care to understand, it's your problem, fix it, don't force us to use 4G data.",1,2024-12-14 01:20:30

I am playing it right now it is quite exceptional. You can obtain not only anime girls but also boys. The visuals are also impressive and the world exploration is also great. The game mechanism is very friendly as it doesn't require much time to understand. It is at some point better than genshin impact. I don't know much about the story because I just completed 33% of the story and it is going very well.,5,2024-12-12 11:22:08

Very nice graphics, character designs, music and concept of the game itself; main story and other quests are boring and it would be better if dialogs weren's this large and full of unnecessary things (also text is not synchronized with what voice actors say). There are obvious borrowings from other games and they are making expirience somewhat worse to be honest, but it was unavoidable for the start i guess and wuwa will be more unique in the future or i hope so",5,2024-12-11 02:20:33

"Probably the best gacha game out there. Gameplay is excellent for a mobile game. But the performance is quite poor, I can barely play the game on my phone, it crashed multiple times, on PC the performance improved since launch but I hope it improves more on here.

"Great game. I really feel like it's pushing the genre forward. My only feedback is on the graphic detail. I completely understand it's a huge game to be able to run smoothly at a 100%, especially on mobile. However, I feel like adding an option to run this game on mobile on 120 FPS would do the graphics wonders. I just feel like compared to other mobile games of this genre, it falls just a tad short. But besides that, an absolutely amazing game 7.5/10",5,2024-12-07 12:01:42

"The game is good. The combat, the designs, the exploration is all a praise from me but I want to talk about the graphics. The anti-aliasing makes everything look blurry and without it, the game looks so rough. The LOD is still low and the render distance is very limited. These two problems have been an eyesore for me but I guess that's how they got the game running on mobile devices for now. Hopefully this will be fixed in the future. Fantastic game nonetheless",3,2024-12-07 05:53:38

Ngl probably my favourite gacha game of all time (except fate grand order) and the combat and visuals are so freaking good. Not to mention the developers really outdo themselves with each patch and it's very F2P friendly and not that time consuming because of the recent qols.

Lost 50% character rate up lots of time around 60-70 pull which is very cruel. What's the point of playing a gacha game if you can't obtain your favourite characters. I know they're giving a lots of rewards but their 5 star rate up is terrible,1,2024-12-07 01:51:32

This game has one of the best open world building like NPCs are no pushovers and can kill monsters. monsters fight vs each other which is cool. Biggest issue is it's very clunky on mobile feels like playing in a mud. buttons are close to each other which lead to pressing wrong buttons giving bad game experience. Controller support needs optimization as it doesn't feel smooth. HP potions can only be used once in a team comp with cooldown makes it worse too. That limit and cooldown should go too.,3,2024-12-02 05:08:00

One of the few gripes I have is the fact that there are too few male characters in the game. Please introduce more male characters, Kuro! Another small thing would be to try making the character swap icons on the screen and their names look more clean and finished and just appealing. For some reason I get an unfinished feel from it.

"Everything is amazing! Also big ups to developers for listening to players. Many problems were fixed in 1.2 update. Except the lock-on-enemy.its almost non existent when playing Tactical Holograms. P.S.-Tactical Holograms are still garbage..its not hard and challenging,its just lazy development, where enemy's every move is just one shot, too much unnecessary animation and lightning, its like the game going unreasonable length just to make it harder.",5,2024-12-01 19:58:11

Best gatcha game I've ever played! The best part is you don't feel the fear of missing out on progress if you are not glued to the game 24/7. You can play the game for 15 minutes a day and won't miss anything. If you miss energy refill it is stored. The game is optimized for less powerful devices. Astonishing graphics and overall user experience. Voice acting is top notch. There is not much of a content yet. I've finished almost everything after 2 months but they are adding new stuff regularly.,5,2024-11-30 21:14:42

"REASON FOR MY 4 MONTH ABSENCE OF THIS GAME The Mt. Firmament update(Version 1.1) made the game unplayable for me. With frame drops and ping spikes! It wasn't like this before, I could run the game smoothly even with medium graphic setting.

After losing my first account, I started over and worked hard, building high-level progress with top-tier items and heroes. However, after an update, all my progress disappeared, and my old account returned. Losing year of effort was devastating and frustrating. The lack of proper account security made me uninstall the game. It‚Äôs disappointing to see hard work erased so easily.",1,2024-11-24 12:03:54

"Wuthering Waves is a very fun gacha game that doesn't require you to play that much and gives plenty of rewards. The game mechanics are fun and interesting. And as an F2P, I am able to get many limited 5-stars still, unlike Genshin Impact, which pretty much requires you to spend money.

"Lovely graphics, mechanics, and gameplay. Character designs are amazing, but the reason this isn't 5-stars is simply due to lack of diversity in characters. Only 1 in 5 characters are male in this game. I know this is common in gacha games such as this, but if they have any chance of truly competing against other gacha game competitors like Genshin and Honkai: Star Rail, they need to balance out the male/female ratio.

"Hey devs, you know the only thing I complain in this game is the top left side of the screen because I can't place my desired button position like what I usually do on some of the most popular mobile shooter games because the quests is the hindrance of it. I just hope there's a button where I can hide it. I just can't do 4 fingers with it where it's way too efficient playing this game.

A triple AAA console quality open world game on your phone for free what more do you want? If you played Genshin impact this will feel familiar. combat is a stand out with the echos transformations. Getting end game gear is EZ with regular world exploring. The story can be hard to follow as a SiFI matrix theme. Combat is Ez for prepared players. Weapon and heros are all RNG pulls. Highly recommend for the open world and the combat the story needs some work Great start for a new game. 10/10.,5,2024-11-22 03:37:37
"Great game. Listen to players, Fun to play, and good characters. But there is something I really see is negative and I hope this Great game will fix it. It is the lack of male characters. And the lack of strong male characters. See real life, who work? Who fights? Men!!! Women mostly live in the kitchen and talk about beaty and make up. What the hell? Woman stronger? I hate everything that is not logical. I will give the company the fifth star if they change this. Thansk for reading.",4,2024-11-22 03:18:41

Playable characters dont even interact with each other at all after the 1.2 story. Camellya is gross and her story made me cringe. She had potential but it was ruined by kuro's new agenda.

"This game is sick. They nailed the action combat, all the characters (including 4 stars) look and feel really good, the world is fun to explore, and the boss fights are challenging and intense. But there is some lag even with lowest settings on S22 Ultra, and no controller support for mobile. I believe there are fixes planned for these issues, which would make this a 5/5 for me. Update: they added controller support, and the game continues to get better",5,2024-11-21 11:01:49

the game is fun so far it just needs more optimization because I'm having lots of frame drops i hope you guys can opt the game sooner for low end devices. And also the loading takes to long to load. I'm really looking forward for y'all to optimise the graphics more because i can barely play enjoy the game i hope u guys can fix the lags and frame drops i hope you guys can adjust the game more for low specs devices:(,2,2024-11-21 09:23:49

"Despite this game being somewhat similar To Gunching impact, hunk eye star real, zone 0.

"The first patch was barely playable, and even later patches remained buggy. The OST was very disappointing, which is one of it's lowest points what with sound as a main theme. Played until 1.3 and dropped it as the repetitive female characters interactions with the MC became more and more dull. it's clearly a game meant for players who want the harem type of experience, rather than a full rounded character story driven game. The combat is fun but it's not enough to make it worth keeping.",1,2024-11-20 09:01:25
Poor experience on the phone. Constant lagging and stuttering. Senstivity is terrible despite that I've reduced it to the lowest setting there is. Graphics are non-existent. I don't feel any consideration from the team to make this game enjoyable on the phone. Developers are always licking the male player base's feet and made me lose my respect for this game.

Would have been 5 star. But the fact that you create false scarcity through removing resonators from the loot pool killed it for me. It forces you to rush through the game if you want them and the grind gets a little repetitive and frustrating because the enemies become way to big of a bullet sponge due to certain resources being timegated blocking you from getting op faster.,3,2024-11-20 01:34:35

"I have been in love with Wuthering Waves since release. Even though my phone heats up really quickly on the lowest settings, I just need to get a new phone later on. The graphics and gameplay are beautiful and fun. I am so invested in the story that I don't even skip the side quests. 10/10.",5,2024-11-18 23:24:58
very good oo,5,2024-11-18 23:14:39
So beautiful and entertaining omg. I been trying a couple of games with more than 4.5 each and this one its winnig so far.,5,2024-11-18 23:11:59
I hope there will be a crossover between wuwa and punishing gray raven... And one more thing please fix fps drops and optimisation of the game i hope this game will have optimisation and smooth gameplay like punishing gray raven( upto a certain level) for low end devices well that's all. All the best kuro games!,4,2024-11-18 23:10:44
"This game is great! The features, story lines, characters, there's also a lot of rewards, and events, there's so much to explore, fun puzzles and catching echos. One thing the game lacks is, optimization, the render is slow and it's laggy even with a decent phone, the game's fps increases if I use a mirror mode which usually makes phone more slow, but the fps increased due to the smaller pixels rendering. Some of the textures are grainy which really bothers me. I hope it will soon be optimized.",5,2024-11-18 23:01:34
Perfect Game,5,2024-11-18 22:58:07
let me play in 30 days and I will fill honest answer,5,2024-11-18 22:56:38
Why did the graphic quality decreased after the recent update? Not looking very good for this games future.,2,2024-11-18 22:46:00
"Hands down one of the better games in the current pool of mobile gaming. From the character design, the plot, the dialogues, and especially the exploration. Not to add, seamless transitions through battle and idle. The developers know what they're doing and are generous enough towards the playerbase and another plus, they actually listen. However, maybe a bit more optimization could help, but for a game that's been out for less than a year? Seems promising, highly recommend.",5,2024-11-18 22:43:07
the best game after genshin impact I love it,5,2024-11-18 21:31:36

Graphics and performance is amazing, very optimized for my Helio G99 phone which is considered a bad gaming chip. Impressive considering this game is UE4. Building characters don't take too long.

"Having played the main competitor since launch, I can say with certainty that I prefer this game significantly. The art direction is supreme, character designs and animations are ridiculously good looking, the world is great fun to explore from a visual standpoint and combat is hard enough that it feels like you've accomplished something as a player when you beat the ""abyss"" content, Tower of Adversity.

There are a LOT of issues in terms of performance. I have no clue why they made this game for mobile as it's very clearly a PC or console type game. It's way too fast paced involving too many buttons pressed to be on mobile. The buttons required to play correctly just clutter the screen entirely. That being said the performance on PC is abysmal. Incredible laggy and leaks so much memory. The game isn't suited for mobile and it's not optimized for PC use. These devs have a lot of work to do.,1,2024-11-17 06:20:36

The game optimization is improving every patch!
