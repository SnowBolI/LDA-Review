"They won't let you write a review about products sold and shipped by them if it's one star. Every reason they gave has been mentioned in other reviews.

Although delivery is quite smoothly. I always struggle to pay via Amazon South Africa.

"Three weeks ago, I ordered the blu-ray disc for my gaming console to watch. When I inserted in, it gave me the ""license restriction"" message. I looked at the back of the blu-ray disc and it has Regional Code B, NOT A.

The new app format is not good. Going into orders used to show everything from top to bottom in the order you were receiving them.

Bad for your battery. This app will deplete your battery by playing ads continuously. These ads ensure that your phone can't turn off the screen. I sat the phone down and went to fold laundry and over 20 minutes later the screen was still on. My phone is set to turn off the screen after 3 minutes of inactivity. Amazon app behaves like malware that overrides a phone's settings through the use of repetitive ads. This is also a major security issue because the phone can't lock the screen.,1,2025-06-11 23:01:59

I would say it was something Illegal.,1,2025-06-10 23:51:48

AI features are a dealbreaker because they are annoying and get in the way of browsing. I would literally buy more stuff from Amazon if they would just effing disable their AI features. I'm not gonna deal with that AI summary popup that appears on product listings. and the Rufus icon on the toolbar at the bottom of the screen is a huge waste of space and too hard to hit accidentally.,1,2025-06-10 19:52:01
Starting to lose faith. I'm a Prime member yet been having terrible service. Like telling me my delivery date is one day but keep pushing it out after I order. one item has been pushed out 3 days from original delivery date.

Amazon keeps trying to push for people to make individual prime accounts to the point where they ruin options they had for years. Give us back the archive purchases feature I dont share my account with people but its embarrassing to have to cover my phone when looking at my orders. You're ruining your own website by trying to push a fake family account model for money. I use my account on my own I want to keep my things private just incase someone does look for something.,1,2025-06-08 12:42:13

"Small pitch idea for Amazon, what if for every NEW user, you'd get at least just idk.. 12 to 10 items free, at the same time you could have security measures and make sure no one is making too many accounts at once to loop the repeat process, and if you try and reset your account nothing will change, meaning you've already got your 10-12 items free, no more after, none the less Amazon is a 10/10 app, and id recommend to any Re-enactors, this helped me find some German ww2 uniforms for mycosplay",5,2025-06-08 05:41:55
"It's one of the biggest companies in the world but, this year they are doing so bad, they dont even care about customers, just care about the money. amazon used to be great, but now it's just horrible, im having problems with every single order.

What is happening to Amazon. I can't get most items delivered to home anymore. Prices change when you put item in cart. Less & less variety offered. No more free first reads. Requires me to pick up at Whole Foods which is 45min or more drive for me. Movies don't have in scene x-ray available any more. More of family & friends have switched to Walmart subscription. Think it's time to close this account. I don't understand why apps are getting worse & worse instead of better as time goes on.,2,2025-06-08 03:38:26

"Delivery drivers, don't speak or read English. Everytime now, they have not followed the app instructions on where to leave deliveries. Most chuck it on my doorstep, rather than my saved preferences. I've even left notes on the door, saying leave with neighbour. They've then took the parcel back rather than follow instructions. The drivers are thick! and most stuff is being sold as proper stuff, but it's China tat. Gone down hill this company. Maybe a bit of vetting in the job application. Avoid",1,2025-06-05 20:29:41

Just stupid. companies get rich then service goes downhill...everytime,1,2025-06-04 06:53:27

Amazon is discriminating against non-prime members by hogging certain items such as GPUs for their members while offering no alternative for non-prime members. Item hogging should not be a part of membership. The app doesn't stay where you left when you switch apps.

Not even a single message. And now with the holidays coming up, I’ll be forced to wait even longer. This isn’t the first time this has happened.

"International order delivery is an absolute mess. On May 19, Amazon claimed “There was a failed delivery attempt. They will try again.” But there was no second attempt and no notification—no email, no SMS, nothing. I only found out what happened after digging through Royal Mail’s tracking and being redirected to Slovak Post. The app should provide accurate updates or make it clear when local carriers take over and stop pretending they'll ""try again"" if that's not happening🤦",1,2025-06-02 18:40:56

After seeing how happy we were with Amazon and Amazon Prime, our social circle now shops with Amazon. Our family works with a philanthropic organization, and a charitable organization that trains service dogs & they're now getting all essentials from Amazon because of the reliability and cost savings.",5,2025-05-28 00:11:31

"This app has always been a clunky mess. The organization of menus and finding things is pretty bad. I've always managed to find what I need, but now notifications just don't work since the Android 15 update. I have enabled every single notification option in both the app and my device settings. I also recently factory reset my phone thinking that would help, but it didn't. C'mon Amazon. One of the largest, richest corporations and you have one of the worst app experiences.",2,2025-05-25 23:59:46

"Your customer service representatives are incompetent. I also hate that the suggested items look so good, and then you click on it and it's not what it said it'd be and is not unique from the other suggested lists or items. for example, I clicked on one that had clothing pictures and said clothes and accessories, but when it opened, it was household items and electronics... fix it,please. Also! every item I receive should come in the best size box or bag. I got my earbuds in a package 10x larger",2,2025-05-25 22:40:12

The last update ruined the whole app for me. nothing is where it used to be and searching through myorders to find something I bought years ago is impossible. The search has to be done year by year. If you don't remember when you bought it you'll be searching for hours. It took me the longest to find my orders because now Prime is where the orders used to be. This latest update is a disaster.,1,2025-05-25 19:17:03

so I've used Amazon for years and I can't access my old account so I literally made a new email and went to sign up and it said the app detected suspicious activity and prevented me from creating my new account. I un-installed the app and an now reinstalling the app to see if that fixed the issue. The problem still persists.,1,2025-05-25 10:05:56
convenience should not be like shuffling through pages for the correct service. so many of these options for account is synonymous with another feature. it is also shuffled with marketing and advertising options. they should not be so curfuclled and optioned for every minutia of detail. other than that Amazon is so convenient,2,2025-05-25 10:04:42

The operator basically stated if I didn't like it to cancel the order and get a refund. I don't believe that's good customer service.,1,2025-05-22 06:06:27

Lately the tracking and shipping of my packages has been awful. My items are constantly getting delayed and sometimes it will say an item was delivered when it wasn't. I have to jump through 70 million hoops just to contact the seller it seems at times. I don't really see the point in paying for premium anymore because nothing shows up on time and I feel like I'm getting second rate service. Premium is a scam.,2,2025-05-22 04:44:29

"First of all, amazon courier called for confirmation, I found he actually cancelled my order without consent, the CS are just a confused bunch who kept transferring me from one to another and then were like.. oh just made a new order and waited 5 days for the refund.. Seriously? Is that what professional means? Amazon has already gone down the hill, a while ago they would've called to confirm cancellation, issued a new order on the spot.. Now they're relying on a broken AI bot and confused CS",1,2025-05-16 22:29:41
I'm just about fed up with this company. the past three orders I've placed have been delayed for days on end. I don't know why this company chooses to list products that aren't available in stock.

Then one minute after he left they sent me another code,1,2025-05-15 00:51:04

Can't stand these Amazon drivers showing up at the house before 4AM and causing the dogs to go insane and waking up the entire house.

Edit: Most of the crashes have been fixed UNLESS you go to submit a 1 star customer service review (coz customer support is awful). App will crash so they don't get that 1 star review 💀 Associates love playing hot potato and never understand the issue. The membership is becoming not worth it.

"I have been with Amazon for 20 years this year. I've seen some goods and bads, but I'm here to review the struggling app. Who else can't see current and previous orders anymore? This used to work fine and I just received an update and thought this must fix it. Nope. Go to the orders tab and it is blank. it appears to be trying, but nothing shows up. Secondly, to reiterate others here, the app shows way more Chinese 3rd party knockoffs than accessing Amazon from my PC desktop.",2,2025-05-08 16:52:32

been using Amazon forever and thanks to AI and questionable sellers it is a miserable shopping experience. if I buy an article of clothing in a medium every time I try to select a different size for a completely different article of clothing it tells me that I need to get a medium there is no way to disable Rufus it pops up all the time recently if I have to open a different app and try to go back to my Amazon session as quick as 30 seconds later it makes me start all over,1,2025-05-08 07:25:18
this app just suddenly disappeared from my apps and then I can't get it back so the only way to use it I have to go to the play store. I tried to uninstall it but it wouldn't let me do that.,1,2025-05-08 07:02:15

"This app is pissing me off. I've tried on multiple phones with multiple different emails, because I want to order things. It doesn't let me make an account on any electronic.

"Using Amazon is becoming a problem. Especially when it comes to shipping. Being a Prime member. when i make a purchase and 2 day delivery stated. Yet more and more deliveries arw taking 5 or more days. Sadly the item us needed prior to a weekend trip or vacation. Even if a family memeber is going abroad. Amazon is becoming a huge let down. Prime and its ADS. Shipping, Price of Movies. Really rethinking the price and its worth in value and frustration.",5,2025-05-08 05:13:46

Amazon has gone down hill. They have the worst customers service. User be aware. Not recommended!,1,2025-05-08 04:19:43
Paying for Prime doesn't guarantee timely delivery. Customer service is mostly slow AI Chat. Not impressed with the service or the quality of products offered. Used this platform for years and things are getting worse.,1,2025-05-08 04:14:08
Very Good,5,2025-05-08 04:06:19
"Amazon was good once upon a time, maybe 5-10 years ago. Most recently I put in an order, waited for it to ship, one day, two days, three days, and the day before the delivery Amazon cancelled the entire order without explaining why. There was no charge to my credit card. So I closed my account. There's no reason to deal with a sketchy group like these frauds. 0 out of 5",1,2025-05-08 04:05:43
bought Amazon prime because I was advertised to get an item I needed by the next day after the merely 3 minutes it took for me to sign up and pay for prime it said it wouldn't get to me until 2 days. chat is unavailable for some reason. says the don't accepts callbacks right now. what a joke,1,2025-05-08 04:05:04
"amazon has no way of tracking their drivers or providing contact information. I have been dealing with their ""customer service"" whom cannot seem to provide any information on where exactly is my package. nor do they care to hold the driver's responsible for being negligent in reading the additional instructions in order to do their job properly. Amazon's answer to this problem is to have the customer get a refund, only for the customer to go through the exact same process over and over again 🙄",1,2025-05-08 03:58:50

"Amazon used to offer quality service, but now their shipping and delivery has gone downhill and you can't make comments related to issues with their shipping on their website or app. They offer ""two-day"" shipping, but often it takes longer. Amazon as a service with their prime membership offers nothing different than literally any other online shopping site.",1,2025-05-08 02:41:56

"Amazon. One of the biggest online stores ever. Ebay and others have been around as well. What 👉🏾 I like about Amazon is its quick delivery, even with all what's going on about those ""tariffs."" Though the drivers never follow my instructions 🙄, at least they put my package by my door. If 🚚 ordering from afar, this is where you get the slowest times ⏲️ and price jumps...it's unfortunate, but DHL & others may still have the same or higher price! Choose wisely.",4,2025-05-08 00:00:58

Amazon has changed how the world goes about getting everything. And I mean everything. For a person that does not have a car it is a real life saver. So thinks for everything y'all do Amazon it's very appropriate.,5,2025-05-07 19:37:29

"What's the point of delivery instructions when they're never followed? What's the point of being told how a parcel was delivered when it's always incorrect (claiming handed to resident when left at back door, or vice-versa?). Teach your drivers that there's more to their jobs than getting a parcel to an approximation of an address. For everything Amazon does well, it has an enormous knack for getting too much wrong. Funnily enough, DPD, and even Evri always get it right. Why not Amazon?",1,2025-05-07 17:58:09

"Don't deal with these people, they're crooks. I bought a laptop for $700 and after waiting patiently for 5 weeks, they cancelled it. Amazons idea of a resolution was that I reorder it at their new price of over $300 more. Disgusting practices and I'm seeking legal advice. I'll stick with Ali Express or eBay in future, the few issues I've had with them have been resolved satisfactorily. I was about to switch to Amazon music from Tidal as well but I won't give Amazon another penny after this.",1,2025-05-07 15:52:30

"Be aware that if you are ordering items from Amazon, especially electronic items, there will be a strong chance that the stereo or DVD/CD player you pay for, will be sent from China. Even if the seller has an 'American' sounding name, more than likely, you will never get what you paid for. You will get a receipt and tracking number, but it will never be shipped.

i canceled prime. the value is not worth it. now they play full commercials in front of all their videos.

not a very good experience trying to buy the gift card and also use my debit card .. I was charged for prime and also a wig that I purchased. finally decided to buy a gift which took an hour to come through and not 5 minutes as advertised.

"I am giving Amazon and Amazon Logistics a one-star rating due to ongoing issues with my deliveries. Frequently, drivers mark my packages as delivered when they have not actually arrived. This practice often occurs when drivers are running late, and it results in significant inconvenience for me as a customer. When I place an order, I expect my packages to arrive on the promised date. However, Amazon has proven to be undependable and unreliable when it comes to on-time deliveries.",1,2025-05-05 01:21:40

Then, the delivery is rescheduled for the next day, but again, no one delivers the package. In the end, I spent two days waiting at home for a delivery that never came.

I have had a love/hate relationship with Amazon for several years. They have very competitive prices and the Prime option makes their delivery unmatched by any other competitor in the business. Now the hate relationship. About 6 or 7 years ago I was undecided between two vendors. I kept going back and forth. When I chose one I paid and realized I needed to go to the other one. So I cancelled and switched. I don't know what happened but I have had trouble paying for items for identity reasons. BS,3,2025-05-04 06:20:07

Convenient shopping but late/lost orders and can't follow delivery instructions leaving packages in the rain/snow. Apps algorithm for product searches is mediocre at best. Better more accurate products show later on your pick up where you left off lists etc. App listens to you when you talk for suggested products too so yea there's that.

None of the sponsored items load when you click on them. If you're a seller I highly recommend you do not sponsor your item. Locker pick ups don't work. The app doesn't load the next step. Absolutely absurd that a company this big placed lockers in several locations just for the app to not work when trying to pick up at the locker.

"would give the app 5 stars because on the 1 hand it functions well but the MAJOR downside is, as someone with severely limited vision, they still do not have any way to apply dark mode(not even force dark mode under development settings). I can barely see anything that has the black text on white background. it took me 45 minutes to look up something that should of taken no more than 5 and gave me a fairly massive headache from eye strain doing so. almost feels like willful contempt from them",2,2025-05-01 16:07:38

I alerted Amazon to fraud in my account through my bank. I alerted them to the fact that my Amazon account was hacked and they did nothing.

Deliveries are late More than on time! More and more the Amazon drivers aren't delivering packages or deliver to another address and they aren't there. You can't review products until you spend a certain amount using a debit or credit card plus meet other guidelines. I ordered something that was packaged poorly and came crushed and they didn't want to hear about it. It isn't friendly to people who keep there credit or debit cards locked when not in use as they don't charge when purchased.,1,2025-05-01 01:55:55

I hate the new interface. It used to be when you got notifications about packages the app would open directly to the details on that package. Now it just takes you to a main shopping page then you have to hit your profile picture then orders then figure out what order you got a notification on . The account button doesn't even have the t at the end. I can't turn off add notifications anymore which it super annoying.

"I usually don't have trouble with Amazon, but this past experience has been pretty bad. My package has been out for delivery for 4 days and has no sign of arriving at my house yet. Every attempt I have with getting in contact in the past couple of hours has been hit with AI. There is no sign of actual people able to help. I don't usually have trouble so this is out of the blue. I hope Amazon adds a feature where you can chat with actual people in the future and breaks out of the AI trend.",3,2025-04-26 07:11:44
"Ultra high battery drain while using this app, over 10%/hr. I suspect it's the silly pure white background that activates 100% of the red, green, and blue pixels on an oled screen.

I want a filter setting in the store to not show me cheap garbage. Your store is completely taken over by garbage. Its basically shopping on Temu but more expensive plus need a subscription. I will likely stop using Amazon cause I can't find anything worth purchasing anymore.

can someone please tell me what's the point in me paying for an Amazon prime account which gives you supposed reassurance that your merchandise will get to you by a certain day and time just for them to turn around and continuously say unfortunately your package arrival time has been pushed back to the point where by the time I get said items I will no longer need them so again someone please remind me why I pay extra for my Amazon prime membership?,1,2025-04-26 02:27:36

I spend more time filtering scam or knockoff products than it would take to just purchase a legit item somewhere else. Amazon needs to force all sellers to list the country of origin for their products and add a filter for customers. Delivery reliability is getting worse. The return policy has gotten worse. Fake reviews. Overpriced goods. It's honestly not much better than Temu or Alibaba at this point. I've been pushing myself to buy from manufacturer storefronts directly more and more.,1,2025-04-21 18:04:15

they straight up lie to you about delivery times just so you don't go to the store and buy something. it's very intentional they don't want you to go to the store and buy something so they'll lie and say they can get it there the next day and then all of a sudden it turns into 3 days later.,1,2025-04-19 21:05:18

"It's hard to believe that with the revenue Amazon makes, the app offers such a mediocre experience (or perhaps it's because they don't need it).

Amazon has become indistinguishable from every other drop-shipping flea market app. It's been decades and there is still no dark mode. Forced ads in notifications. Prime cost goes up while the quality of life for the consumer goes down. Products flooded with cheap knock offs with no quality assurance. All of your data is being intrusively collected and sold. You will return 70% of the things you buy. This process isn't sustainable. Just buy elsewhere and save yourself the trouble.,1,2025-04-19 13:59:15

Amazon is the fastest way to get what you need. I can only think of one time that I didn't get what I ordered on the day they said it would arrive but I got it early the next morning.

Stop messing with the UI...every update makes it worse! First you made it more difficult and many more steps to access lists. Please stop. And please make it easier to get to my wish lists again!

"What a joke. You pay for Amazon prime to get fast, free shipping and now they won't deliver on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. If you need something delivered on the weekend, you better look somewhere else.",1,2025-04-17 22:30:48
"This app is terrible, Can't zoom in on any picture with small type while scrolling down, often times the only place to get specs on product. Can only zoom in on main picture gallery which has diff pics, but not while scrolling down main page, how dumb.",1,2025-04-17 21:32:30
what can you say,5,2025-04-17 21:14:35
Why on earth is there no dark mode? Honestly it's very convenient to use the app but that's severely outweighed by getting blinded each time I open it. You can't tell me it's not a super easy fix to implement as well. Happy to change my review if this is fixed.,1,2025-04-17 19:04:04

"great if you like to experience volatile algorithmic pricing, the feeling of crushing hopes and dreams, if you avoid ethical concerns, if you really don't want to know how your money is being handled, if you want constant badgering to join their club, if you don't want to consider tax... otherwise horrible",1,2025-04-17 18:18:05

"It'd be really great if I could edit my shortcuts for things I ACTUALLY use on a regular basis and be able to rearrange the order of them too. Also, please make Whole Foods completely separate. Quite annoying to constantly change delivery from local Whole Foods (from store pickup) to home address when I'm ordering anything after I ordered store pickup groceries. It can't be that difficult for such a large company to figure out, that or they're too big to care about inconveniences like that",2,2025-04-17 18:02:12

I can't do anything, I have a cake at the store waiting for payment and a few other things to get for the party, and I have to cancel everything because of their ""issue"" if you can take people's money that easy you should be able to give it back in a timely manner. Unacceptable.",1,2025-04-16 21:43:39

"The discrepancy is that Amazon is taking my money for an order without my approval. I ordered some goldenseal last month, and they debited for me again this month. I didn't want them to do this. I canceled the order as soon as I saw what happened. Due to their refund policy, I may have to wait 30 days. That's a good reason to cancel my membership. You all are doing too much hustling, and you are crashing.",2,2025-04-16 21:30:14
"Please remove the AI chat bar that blocks the bottom view! Ridiculous that has to be removed EVERY TIME when the option is at the bottom right corner too!

"I love prime but I've been having an annoying nuisance of a problem when the app says ""order within 3 hours (etc. time quote) and get the package by tomorrow/day after tomorrow"" but then when I order, it IMMEDIATELY tells me it ""will be delivered on"" and names a day that's past what it told me. I believe this is called false advertising, specifically because it tells you one thing in order for you to buy immediately and then doesn't deliver (literally!!) on what it promises.",4,2025-04-16 19:29:10
The past several orders have been days late.. Have an order right now that hasn't showed up and is past 2 days late. Amazon is not what it used to be. you pay for prime but don't get treated as a prime member.,1,2025-04-16 19:14:12

"As with Prime membership, delivery delays are becoming a recurring issue. When I try to cancel my Prime membership, they says that the amount cannot be transferred to the original payment method. This is a fraud on the customer. I have a long pending issue with Amazon regarding double payment. For almost 9 months, there has been no attempt from Amazon to resolve it. amazon is not giving importance on customer satisfaction, they are just protecting the delivery agents only.",2,2025-04-16 11:21:54

"Amazon is what it is, people are going to continue to use it regardless of how bad it becomes. My biggest issues with this app are the fact that filters mean absolutely nothing, You can set them to be as precise as you like but will still see page after page of unrelated (usually cheap trash) items because they paid the most for that placement. Next would be that reviews are completely packed with fakes and there seems to be no policing on it. And lastly that nothing is done about pricing scams.",2,2025-04-15 01:01:32

If you write a review that is in any way negative they will not publish it because it's a greedy corporate entity that doesn't care how items are sold on their platform. They constantly change the app so you don't get used to where everything is and make it confusing as hell,1,2025-04-13 06:18:33

I love amazon but the app has issues with no way to give them feedback on the app itself. it keeps changing from my default address to another address and I don't notice until after I make an order which means I have to cancel then hunt for everything again so I can reorder it and make sure it goes to the correct address.,3,2025-04-13 05:06:16

Either you are so intelligent or we are dummy! I am searching for a clear brand or model of item but the first 2 items listed are not related to any of my interests or search items. That will reduce trust and loyal customers to the Amazon brand. Please consider what the customer wants or is searching for. You can still put some promoted items in other places.,1,2025-04-13 01:11:20

Why do you offer a lower and then make the order even send an invoice and don't charge the credit card until it's shipped thats makes no sense charge the card the same day the order is placed. That's like saying let's if you have the money at the time of order and we ll wait 2 weeks and we still want to have that same money available that we charged you for but yet the order is placed but not charged.

"A service that changed our way of life, even if I still prefer the early years of Amazon, with better high-end electronics, more frequent deals, and a lower spending limit for free shipping.

Customer Service is abysmal. Working with them is terrible and designed to make you give up. The service as a whole is ok as long as nothing outside of their script happens. this is even more true for the bot screening questions at the beginning. Overall an experience that will make you not want to shop with Amazon anymore.,1,2025-04-08 05:35:39
"Should be a zero for customer service, They ask you to make a police report if the package gets sent back to the shipper. But the police and Ups are not dumb like Amazon and a police report can't get filed if the package isn't missing. You call Amazon back and they say you have to file a police report. Worst delivery company policies of all delivery companies. New leadership took over and everyone else suffers, goodbye.",1,2025-04-08 05:31:51

I have ordered from Amazon for the first time. I am happy with my order. but I am not very happy about not getting to use the rest of my Amazon gift card Balance on another order. this needs to be fixed. you shouldn't have to keep ordering other items that you don't want just to get you order or have to sign up for a Amazon prime account or credit card just to order from Amazon. that is just like forcing someone to buy things they don't want. please fix it . thanks,2,2025-04-04 15:46:39

"I love ordering from Amazon, but I absolutely hate that it waits for your package to ship before taking the payment. No other website I've ordered from does that. My last order was of 7 products. Three of those products arrived in 3 days. The four books I ordered are going to take 3 weeks to get to me. This is what has gotten me to not use the app as much anymore. Waiting 3 weeks is wild for some books. I'll just pay the couple extra dollars and go to Walmart.",3,2025-04-03 04:20:58

"there is absolutely ZERO reason why I should not able to cancel memberships of prime or subscriptions through video through their apps. Instead they force you to do so on their website. Amazon is a harmful monopoly taking advantage of its users... Also, can't use the app with a VPN effectively. Clearly they prioritize data collection over anything else. Logically it makes no sense at all. Especially when it works fine on PC. Additionally, their help desk is ridiculously annoying and unhelpful",1,2025-04-03 03:05:21

I am giving a 2 star due to Rufus not only being added but for not being able to disable it. It comes up on your screen every time you click something and no matter what you are not able to hide it completely so it covers small portions of the screen which on a Samsung device you may need to click on some of the things it covers and the meer fact you can't disable it and no other option is ridiculous!

After submitting my documents, my account works fine, but the discount disappears! If verification was truly needed, why not ask earlier?

The only reason I bought these things on Amazon was for convenience and timing. they lie about the delivery window to make the sale and then hope you don't notice.,1,2025-03-22 20:51:31
regularly promise for on time delivery but then regularly deliver late. why give eta if you regularly don't meet it. go to costco!,1,2025-03-22 20:36:54
Amazon is a joke... if there late which is all the time... they just tell you it sucks to be you and move along... Temu is much better on prices and if there late they give you 5 dollars back on top of it,1,2025-03-22 20:07:06

"Amazon used to be a great place to shop. Now it's become overloaded with so much junk, it's difficult to actually find a decent product. Everything is a cheap knock off of a cheap knock off. Reviews are sounding increasingly fake (like AI wrote them) so I don't trust them anymore. Plus, delivery is steadily getting worse, with packages frequently getting lost or delivered to the wrong house entirely. I'm not renewing again. Thumbs down!",1,2025-03-22 19:47:08

I'm very disappointed in all the commercials while watching prime. when I first got Prime I was paying for no commercials with great shows and free delivery. now it seems I'm only paying for delivery. the commercials get longer and longer as I watch and now I have to pay even more if I want no commercials. I think 30 sec commercials are fine. but 1 min then 2 min. very disappointing,2,2025-03-22 12:48:18

The app works ok but Amazon service and deliveries keep going downhill fast. Packages are delayed more and more. They often play a switcheroo between search and payment (e.g. the result shows delivery next day but shipping is actually three days). They don't pay their workers enough and rely too much on automation and AI. Prime fees keep going up and you get less and less. It's also very annoying to need to leave the app to purchase a prime video or kindle book.,1,2025-03-18 19:01:11

I'm out my whole order and $80+ because the drivers are to lazy to deliver to my front door. No longer any real perks to being a prime member, prices have stayed the same but everything else has decreased immensely. At this point I'd rather use temu.

"They added this annoying useless AI feature called ""rufus"" to answer ""frequently asked"" questions that no one would ever actually ask because no one cares. Of course the low-IQ product managers at Amazon think that it's very very very very important that you get answers to these questions that you don't care about so they made sure that there's no way to turn it off.

Since I have to jump through hoops to contact any kind of support in human form on Amazon I'm going to leave a review here. Customer service is all but non-existent. The rapid decline of Amazon services from 2020 to now is astonishing. We're now in the stage we're not only do you treat your employees like garbage but now your customers. You offer absolutely no form of human interaction without jumping through extensive hoops. Treating your customers like nothing more than a problem that AI,1,2025-03-10 21:39:11

Ask for if the money that was taken off for order I didn't make. Could be put on order I do want to make. 3/10/2025 U should discount us on order not arriving in time.

Only ever gotten knock off products lately when I buy stuff shipped and fulfilled through Amazon. Shipping can take months with all the delays and sometimes never shows up in the first place. They keep changing the app around making it difficult to navigate. The prices are rarely better than if you were to go at the store or buy it from the manufacturer website and the product information is almost always lacking in detail on items. Used to like the service but it is a shell of its former self.,1,2025-03-09 06:45:11

Amazon is great like others say it is very convenient helpful when don't have a chance to go out so far to get what you are looking for need or want.

I am also fed up that amazon has become nothing but another version of ebay full of chinese knockoffs, false advertising, and fake reviews. It just keeps getting worse, not better.

Horrible new design. Please put things back and refresh the view and limit how much you make the users lives miserable. People shouldn't have to re-learn an app to find things that were easy to locate. I get that you want people to find new things they didn't know were there but that's not going to happen when the person just wants to look up one thing. Just like going to the grocery store and finding every ile in the store moved and now that trip that you only had 15 min takes 30 minutes. Smh,1,2025-03-06 09:50:44

Amazon isn't worth shopping at. Delivery sucks and NOTHING is NEVER delivered on time. Most package not even bring through Amazon anymore. They pass them on to other carriers then everything gets mixed up and everyone start pointing fingers. Keep boycotting Amazon 💩ty service. Still waiting on a bed that was supposed to be delivered on the 3rd NEVER got it even though it was on the truck out for delivery. Never received it the next day either. Here it is the 5th still no DELIVERY. 😡,1,2025-03-06 07:23:50

The fact that I cannot archive an order on my app is a huge headache. I have previews of a gift popping up over and over again because it's at the top of the list. What's the point of nondescript packaging if I now have to worry every time I open the app sitting near someone? What if this was something private?

Amazon app has bugs and issues. Account settings shortcut in the app is gone (iPhone). App navigation on Android is different and easier. Whatever upgrade (downgrade) they did has made the app more difficult to navigate for an iphone.,2,2025-03-04 11:01:28

This is for the recent update. March 2025: This app is hands down the worst experience in an app I've used if not everyday then most days. They made everything not intuitive; there is one button i the middle for everything making it more than one tap for things that used to be one. Getting to purchases and account settings is far more confusing than it used to be. Still no dark mode in 2025! So when I open the app at night I'm blinded no matter how dim my screen is.,2,2025-03-04 10:12:01
Dark mode! Please!!! 😵,3,2025-03-04 10:11:06
I think it is a wonderful app other then I didn't know how to put it on my main page as a app from the play store ..so if you could fix that that would be fantastic. Have a great day,5,2025-03-04 09:35:05

I'm often homebound and recently moved. Amazon is great because of delivery and I can usually find a solution to my storage issue.,5,2025-03-04 02:08:15
The biggest reason why I buy from any online company is to be able to get what I am ordering on the day I'm told it will arrive. If an online company can't deliver when it says it will I might as well go into a store to buy it. And when I purchase an item from a company only because they specify it will be delivered on a specific day and no other reason I expect them to deliver. I'm finding Amazon is becoming like those businesses that don't deliver on time and for that reason I limit what I buy,2,2025-03-04 02:00:23

The UI of this app is terrible. Any UI designer would throw up trying to navigate through the account functionality. It seems they make it purposely difficult to access certain customer functionality or hide it on purpose. An account should be easily navigable. Amazon has gotten lazy and they will keep losing market share to temu shop and other competitors unless they streamline the app experience to not make it so trash. I can't wait till a reliable alternative exists with better UI,1,2025-03-03 23:42:50

"It's a great gift ordering app and I love doing that, but one problem is the drivers from Amazon driving through backyards especially mine. My backyard is messed up because it was driven through. If you can back out of the driveways, do it. If you can't back out, then just pull up in the road next to the ditch and you can walk through the grass or driveway if you want to, but don't drive through grass at anyone's home. That can mess up their grass and fieldlines, so don't do that anymore.",4,2025-03-03 21:46:56

GUI gotten worse & worse over time. Clearly Amazon needs to clean house in the department responsible for this app. Functionality has not improved in ages yet thr team keeps making changes to the GUI that make it more obtuse and push the most used functions deeper.

"Refunds are tricky to get back the way you want. Pre-checked option defaults the refunds to ""Amazon wallet"" and not getting the price back on the credit card used for purchase. This is actually a biggie but a Naive one wouldn't get the difference. It means I cannot purchase gift cards with this wallet. So meaning, one can't get her money back from Amazon wallet without a purchase of physical items. If that's not monopoly, I don't know what is!

This app is convenient and I prefer it to the website unless I need dark mode. Notifications are reliable and useful. This is a power hungry app and the bright white screen doesn't help. Dark mode would be comfy and save battery but developers usually opt out of adhering to Android system settings when accurate color rendering becomes a problem. Probably won't update if it means autocorrect in search fields.,4,2025-03-01 16:37:51

This is a horrible app and I will tell you why. This app won't even let me review and when I go to see why it just brings me to guidelines which does not help when I am trying to leave a bad review on a product. This is also a bad app because it tell me my account does not meet the requirements to review which is stupid because like I just said it brought me to guidelines which doesn't help in any considering that I need to know the reason why I can't review.

Example, Slivor Visoear cleaning tool. It does exist on Amazon, however when you put that in the search. it auto corrects to silver visor. There seems to be no way of searching the keywords I want without some autocorrection. My advice is to remove the auto correct spelling.

Amazon's new policies are awful. They don't really exchange items any more and just offer refunds. So if you happen to get an item on sale and it comes in broken you are out of luck. Can't contact support and your only option is to return it and rebuy it at whatever price it is now at. Most likely full price.,2,2025-02-21 06:38:18

Drivers never follow delivery instructions!!!!! 8/9 of the packages I had ordered the driver ignored the instructions I left specifically to deter theft because I have kids who steal come down my street when they get off school. If it wasn't for me making sure I'm home on delivery day then 6-8/9 packages would have been stolen because they're in plain view on a secondary main road and can see it from the main road. Packages arrive quick but that doesn't mean anything if it gets stolen !,3,2025-02-21 02:53:23

All because of their drivers doing their own thin,1,2025-02-17 10:01:12

"Amazon standards are non existent now. They allow any seller to falsely advertise product, just to let you get swindled, while these people keep scamming. You should only get items directly from them if you are to buy. Otherwise you won't be able to guarantee you are satisfied or get refunds. This is basically ebay now. But I find better deals on ebay",1,2025-02-16 03:17:37

"I dont want this app on my phone. For some reason, amazon shopping is constantly logged in on my phone without me ever using it. This will all of a sudden be on my phone without me ever. It's being used in a shady manner. Amazon is getting all the information, aka data on people just like facebook and selling it for money they use facial recognition without your awareness. It's an invasion of privacy and violates our human rights.",1,2025-02-16 02:47:34
It would be great if they could get some competent developers. This app is a joke if you have a default address and a default payment setup as soon as you use another address it changes to the other address even though when you go back in it still shows the original one is default. Have had to uninstall and reinstall and it still happens of course you can't get a full day many for customer support none of them speak English and all they can do is read off a script.,1,2025-02-16 02:26:00

Amazon can do better with creating the ability to keep orders private and separate. The process is very cumbersome and complicated. You have to create adult accounts for each user. But after attempting to add my wife I sent an invite and it says her account is blocked and is asking her to upload documents. Also you can not easily cancel add on subscriptions such as discovery plus. You should be able to do this on the phone app. They make it complicated on purpose.,1,2025-02-15 08:44:16

The app is generally convenient for shopping on Amazon. However there is no way to see all questions posted for an item. One must solely use the AI search with no way to view any other questions people have posted in case the issue is worded slightly different than what was entered in the question search.

Can you please update your app so we can delete large chunks of saved items like can be done with email? It is the 21st century. Amazon can easily take your money but they don't really care if your order actually gets delivered. Their customer service is a joke and they are virtually unable to solve problems since they are out of the country and out of the loop. Amazon also makes it difficult to get refunds on orders that haven't been delivered. Shop elsewhere!,1,2025-02-14 11:11:31

Amazon is talked up way too much.. I've been trying to get my money back for a coat I had to send back since December. They won't give y money back and won't even say why. Several associates have lied to me about it and a few have actually hung up on me. They won't tell me anything. It was an expensive coat and nothing was wrong with it when I sent it back. They will not give me my money back!!!,1,2025-02-14 06:36:39

"This app used to be fine. It was more convenient to use than going to the website through a browser. Then they added ""Rufus"". Having a pop-up for an AI that I do not want to use forced on me is unacceptable. It only gets in the way. You're supposed to be able to swipe it out of the way, but half the time that doesn't work. If someone stepped in front of people every time they tried to look at something in a real store, that store would go out of business. I got rid of the app because of it.",1,2025-02-14 05:34:43

I have also noticed an increase in reviews being from ""free"" Amazon Vine reviews. I can never trust any product that is reviewed by an ""invite only"" program.

be careful what you buy and always check and research the seller because once you've fallen for a scam you're not getting your money back and amazon won't help or do anything about the scams on their website.

Updating your prime membership is near impossible. You can't even call and do it over the phone. When you try through the app it takes you on a loop to google play. Under subscriptions it has no history of my prime membership. When I tried to enter a new card in my payment method it just gives me an error code. Absolutely ridiculous. Why make this so difficult? Whoever designed this should be working at the warehouse.,1,2025-02-11 23:19:34

Ali Express has a little less Chinese stuff than Amazon. Very unreliable a lot of the time and delays constantly. Cheap junk being listed by sellers there should be a vetting process. Sellers are contacting me directly to give good reviews for free items. Prime is going down hill with delivery dates being about 5 days for a FBA Amazon item sometimes even longer. Amazon staff always fob me off on the chat. Very unprofessional. Pretty much the same as Ali Express but more.,1,2025-02-11 03:59:57

Every single time I open the app, I noticed it bought something when I wasn't in the app. It's not a someone hacked into my account and bought something for themselves. No it's stuff I added to my cart, because it's easier then trying to find and get the 'add to list' to work. I AM NOT IN THE APP AND IT IS BUYING STUFF WITHOUT ME.

Used to be good. It's not necessarily the app it's the company it's kind of cheap and sad when you offer overnight shipping or one day shipping and then suddenly change it to three or four days later kind of tired of trying to order something overnight and getting it a week later what's the point then why pay for prime if everything's going to come in late kind of pathetic for a company to offer up overnight and next day delivery and fail to follow through nine times out of 10 come on Amazon,2,2025-02-09 22:36:35

More of an eBay kind-of shopper. I signed up for Prime so I could receive items in haste that often don't have rush delivery available elsewhere. CONSTANTLY lied to about arrival times. Just be honest when my safety gear for my job will be here. I'm sure the Safety Guy won't kick me off the job for not having my PPE I could have bought at Home Depot if only I knew you were MISREPRESENTING your ship times.

"Amazon is it's own scam. This Prime membership that you pay for rarely comes to benefit. Nothing is ever 2 day delivery unless it's something you can buy at the corner store. Therr is always some kind of delivery issue or problem with the original information presented and all you get is a ""we sorry for the delay"" message. I would not recommend this app or Amazon to anyone. Especially this useless Prime Membershio with ""sometimes"" 2 Day Delivery. Often unreliable expectations of delivery times.",1,2025-02-08 06:49:34

Don't like that you can't change sizes on a subscription. Instead you have to cancel it & reorder it with the different size and I'd prefer they charge me when I order it instead of delivery day(I'll accidentally spend it🤣 then the money isn't in there when it's time🤣),3,2025-02-07 20:28:44

And once you try to return the garbage they sent you, they make you go around in circles! Do this, do that, and again and again... Oh, yeah you have to PAY TO RETURN it. We pay Amazon prime but it seems more and more like a WASTE OF MONEY!!",1,2025-02-06 09:53:26

Returns going back to our credit cards should not be hidden at the bottom of the screen with several clicks to find it.

Worst customer service I've ever received. I do not recommend buy anything from this company. You're better off with Temu or Wish than Amazon. I've been trying to get a refund on my product that i didn't receive and even bought TWO police reports to show Amazon that i didn't receive the package and they are denying me a refund without merit. I've been trying ti get a refund for over a month. And then they just keep giving me the run around. Terrible Service.,1,2025-02-02 03:01:01
It's not the app. It's Amazon itself. Their prime membership price has increased SO MUCH. I'm older so I have to manage income but this isn't much of a deal anymore. ALSO SO OFTEN NOW MY ORDERS ARE LATE!!!! They are getting lax and are putting the customers last.,2,2025-02-02 02:44:01

After receiving the wrong product, reporting that it wasn't what I ordered & sending it back to have the right one resent; I was told that I'd be charged a 2nd time for not sending back the item I didn't receive in the first place. I called to sort it out & was told that it was taken care of only to be charged for it anyway. With no way to talk to a US based customer support to actually resolve this. It's either AI or a guy in India. Ridiculous!",1,2025-02-02 02:43:01
"KEEP SEARCH ON TOP!! Most recent update keeps giving error: You cannot buy this item because it is out of stock. But trying again orders it TWICE!

"Amazon customer service team is very disrespectful and inconsiderate. The first item was a book that took two weeks to deliver despite prime membership and the advised delivery time was two days.

Amazon is a place to shop for like anything when I ordered a 3pieceluggage set I got a coupon for a Free shipping and after I order and everything the price was 125 after I was done. The next day I go to see the order and like when it would come I saw the price was 250 which I never got when I ordered it which really surprised me because that has never happened on any other apps I used and I just think that Amazon just had a little glitch or something but if it was I would really recommend a fix,2,2025-02-01 08:12:49

Why a single male needs constant reminders of women's clothing, fashion and jewelry is besides-me. And NO way to segment out notifications anymore. I can't just get delivery notifications. It's either all or nothing. If You can't control yourself, I'll do it for you. 100% all notifications are off.",2,2025-02-01 01:15:32

Been a prime member for 20+ years. Amazon Driver ran over my mail box and didn't report it. After supplying video evidence of the incident which I received from a neighbor. They still refuse to fully pay for the repair of a new mailbox and it's installation. Extremely disappointed and on principle will be shopping elsewhere. Scary part is they deliver all over my neighborhood so I could be stuck paying for another repair from their drivers. Zero stars,1,2025-01-31 21:01:15

Fraudulent customer service. The agent said i should place the order and he will refund the shipping fee. So i place the order and he said he initiated the refund. After several days when i follow it up all the agents i talked to said there's no refund and they can't do a refund even though i sent screenshot of my previous conversation with the agent.

"I order items using prime for two day delivery. On the date of delivery they now say the items are expected in five more days. I look at each item as if I'm ordering a new one and they still say two day shipping or ""at a facility near me"". What is the point of prime if the delivery dates are not truthful? If the delivery dates showed as delayed for a new purchase I would not have an issue. It's the fact that the system is lying saying a new order would be faster than the original.",1,2025-01-31 09:46:58

"I've been a long-time Amazon Prime customer, but lately, I've been frustrated with recurring shipping delays.

I just created a return and your system automatically said you will collect the item tomorrow. But I'm not home tomorrow I'm only available on Saturday. So I try to reschedule it and it says I need to cancel the return and create a new return. What sort of a stupid system is that???? It's ridiculous. So now how do I get it collected on a Saturday???????? Don't deliver damaged products if your return system is useless.,1,2025-01-28 01:27:29

"have fun trying to return something. they keep it on your amazon account balance so that the money still stays within the company. then it automatically applies to any order after despite choosing to use your own card. then, once you use any of thag account balance, theyll refuse to give your refund back to the card originally used. also, customer service is a joke and this is one of the biggest scams ive encountered in awhile.",1,2025-01-28 00:58:20

Delivery is always late even with prime. They no longer ship when you order and instead wait until a window before your delivery date to ship. I've ordered things that have gone out of stock while waiting for them to ship even though I've already ordered resulting in ridiculous delivery times. Two items got pushed back so much that the delivery date I was given ended up being a month after expected delivery WITH prime and they don't honor their late delivery policy. Cancelled everything.,1,2025-01-25 20:43:45

I dislike almost everything about Amazon. I've been locked out of my account since I opened it. Says suspicious activity yet customer service can't find anything wrong. It takes several pages of nonsense to even find the customer service number. Plus the shows on prime play automatically while looking at the preview. I've tried everything to resolve the issues and get the same response from customer service every time. I'd rather shop in person and save my money.

"Turned VERY seedy. Amazon used to be alright, even just several years ago, but it looks like organized crime got their hands in it and now it's very seedy, with ads galore, and sending defective items and keeping people's money instead of refunding their money after receiving the item back, using soothing and reassuring words, but not actually DOING anything.",1,2025-01-22 22:52:32
I use to love shopping at Amazon prime but it takes forever to get your packages. Even the packages they say get the same day take several days or more to get them. Thinking going to try Walmart and see how they do,3,2025-01-22 22:48:37

They're letting go of 1700 people and essentially removing all investments from the Quebec economy, so if they don't provide a better reason, I'll cancel Prime.",1,2025-01-22 21:14:59

This place has become very expensive to shop. There are other places to shop that is more affordable. The same day shipping is actually not same day. The two day is actually not two day shipping. Amazon locks you in to their Prime subscription which is not worth it. You will end up having to pay more because all most of the content that you would rather have is not available on your prime account or you need to subscribe to another streaming provider for said content.

I spent hours adding everything to my cart and made the purchase only to be cancelled because they thought I was not me, even though I had to use a two step process to use my credit card. I did not use the app for that purchase them I thought maybe if I use the app I would be able to get all the item I need.. nope after spending a hour or so trying to make it work,.. terrible...",1,2025-01-19 13:38:08

"Amazon, as in Amazonian Women of California is a program of products that they gave to the Angels to distribute among the models other Angels, so they could have a source of products selection in the United States of America. . It was a private company. Not a public company. When they were sailed it gave the products adversely to porch pirates and hooligans. It was for the protection of American upper class. It's a stolen program from our forefathers that we sponsored our families with.",5,2025-01-19 13:18:24

What happened to dark mode? The app is fine but where did dark mode go? You had it then you updated it and now it seems impossible to find. There's nothing on app settings and if you Google it it tells you to go and change your phone settings to dark mode and that will force the app to go to dark mode. That does not happen.

It's obvious that Amazon's product ratings are rigged and it's OK for company's to bribe customers for positive ratings!!! I pointed this out about a company and amazon sent me a notification that my post was against there rules or standards??? That leaves me to believe that Amazon's rating system is rigged and can't be trusted!!! That also shows me that amazon dose not have it's customers best interests in mind and they prefer dishonest company's over their customers!!,1,2025-01-08 23:40:50

I won't be reviewing anything on Amazon anymore. The reviews refer to a product post. Sellers charge the product and the reviews stay. I've seen some of my own reviews for stuff I never bought. 1 product I can't even review. Both the seller and Amazon claim to not know why. Many merchant posts have several products in a given post. The reviews don't reflect which product it was. At least one seller I'll never buy from again.,1,2025-01-08 16:51:16

Not only is it the most confusingly platform to use but trying to get help for issues you're experiencing is near impossible unless you like talking to bots that'll talk you in circles.

"Curious thing, me and my husband have been paying prime separately since we met. Before I use to have a 2-day shipping option, now it takes more than one week or more; however, if my husband orders the same items, he has the option for the 2 day shipping delivery. Customer service is useless. They don't give a reason, they don't solve it, and they don't care. The funny part is I complained about a delayed delivery, and since then, I have no 2 day shipping option often, make your conclusions....",1,2025-01-04 11:52:35

I called to confirm a delivery because it was late and they assured me it was on the way. 3 hours later i call back they decided it was damaged and wouldnt be delivered today.

"Couldn't get an invoice through the app, had to use the website. Lacks basic features. Layout is terrible, but that can be said about Amazon in general. Annoyingly filters my purchases at ""last three months"" instead of, oh I don't know, ALL PURCHASES! And finally, it has a problem about staying open in the background vs closing the app. It's hard to explain but it's especially apparent when you use a link and it opens the app. Basically, it breaks the app. It's so bad I just use the website.",1,2025-01-03 05:00:22

Now I'm locked out of my account and customer service is zero help. Other than telling me it will take 48hrs to email me a form to fill out so I can prove I'm me,1,2025-01-01 20:09:13

"You can only cancel subscription channels on the Amazon website, but it will NOT open in a web browser. It defaults to the app no matter how you try it. Likewise, you can only make video purchases/rentals on the website yet when you try to go to the webpage in an internet browser it defaults to the app. There are several movies coming out soon I'd like to purchase but if it's going to be this difficult I'll buy them on another platform.",1,2024-12-30 23:37:49
"Don't accidentally order something twice because when you go to cancel the order immediately, they won't allow it. You can request to cancel it, & they'll deny it because they're money hungry thiefs. Then, when you follow their video instructions to return and get a refund, another error pops up basically saying they can't help you. As pricey as amazon is, they have a terrible & broken software. Garbage. You can get the same stuff cheaper on temu. Only difference is faster shipping. Do better.",1,2024-12-30 23:17:26

"I gave 4 stars because I feel Amazon Shopping spoils my family with the speed and efficiency they deliver. This becomes most apparent when you order something from someone besides Amazon and it takes an almost agonizing 3 weeks to arrive! I would give 5 Stars if I wasn't constantly seeing items over priced on Amazon. I'm already paying an annual fee, I expect MSRP.

Dear Lord. Now they have removed the Q&A section. Amazon is going backward in usability faster than I can keep track. The Q&A was invaluable. But they no longer care about customers.

Amazon has chosen destruction. With Bezo selling stocks and they refuse to embrace there will be no banks. Crypto and giftcards will be the only way for a business to stay in business.

only this app appears half the screen has a dark overlay tint. Reinstall fixed app. delivery date changes after you order it. Make sure you order 1 month ahead of a holiday or event. Price goes up at 1 mo bef Halloween. Subscription is supposed to be a better deal. there's an extra fee that makes it cost more than 1x buy.

Canceled 2 important orders from over six months ago mere days before Christmas. Canceled my prime and canceling other pre-orders and moving them to other sites.,1,2024-12-26 17:39:53
"The Amazon app can be frustrating, especially during Prime Day and Black Friday, where pricing feels deceptive. Items are often marked up before being “discounted” making it seem like you’re getting a deal when you’re not. Cancelling Prime if you don't want it anymore is a hassle and customer support can be hit or miss. If you have an issue with an order sometimes you get the runaround or are told you’ve been refunded, only to find out you haven't forcing you to go through the process again.",1,2024-12-26 16:48:15

"Overall I like shopping on Amazon, the one thing that really annoys me is you can't change delivery location once order is placed. There is no way to talk to anyone on a phone/ comms over email. The app loops you back to the order details page where you can't make changes even all the Q&A page told you there is an option but literally is none. I felt sorry for the delivery guy who attempted delivery a couple of times but no one's home & i can't leave msg on my delivery notes, developer, help???",3,2024-12-24 14:44:56

"I don't know who's in charge of developing the layout of this app, but they need to be fired on the spot. Nothing is easy to access, neither is it easy to find. I have to go through a freakin maze just to find my wish/shopping lists, and even there, it doesn't show all my lists that I actually have. My profile can't be reached, my search can't find a thing. Nothing on this app either works well, or doesn't work at all. FIX IT",2,2024-12-23 06:42:29
"Worst shopping ever. Amazon is a scam. Amazon doesn't honor their own sales ad. Customer service lies about refunds . Amazon cancels the free product offered with sales ad (blink cameras). Don't believe Amazon customer service. They even sent confirmation email in writing, then would not honor what they said they would do. Boycott Amazon",1,2024-12-23 06:37:07
Customer service no longer exists. There is no way to actually talk to a person anymore. All of the menus just circle to the front page of the customer service page. My package hasn't had tracking updated in over 15 days and the help section is just an oroborus of menus that all lead back to the first menu. The menu says contact the carrier but how can you when Amazon is the carrier and their contact us rerouts you every time?,1,2024-12-23 06:15:40

I shop Amazon Prime all the time they have a vast selection of things that you think of and some you never new about. Although Amazon is not necessarily the cheapest they do try to keep their prices comparable to other retails. There delivery is timely and pretty much spot on if theirs any change with the date whether it's early or late you will be informed either way mine notifications come in both text and email. Returns are easy and your payment method is usually refunded in a few hours.,5,2024-12-22 21:14:18

"the report bug section is very limiting when it comes to reporting small problems. The link share does not work, it does not copy. For a normal Review.

If you don't tell the delivery person a specific location, they leave it very obvious spot so it's easily stolen, 3 co-workers shared stolen package videos, packages left in plain view.",4,2024-12-21 22:46:47

Don't like the recent changes. Don't like the AI taking up a portion of the screen. Put a button on the screen if you absolutely have to have it. It's very annoying. And what the heck happened to being able to click an image to get full screen and you can Zoom & pinch... and then swipe through the images. The way it's now is just stupid. Now zooming warps the image & doesn't stick because it's a long set of images now. I have to hold the zoom.. Whoever thought this was good was wrong.,2,2024-12-21 12:52:32

Which in talking to support was told I was going to receive credit never gave it then a package that was due yesterday was shipped out of state so now I'm still waiting on and when check on location and ask about my credit I'm pretty much called a liar and a theif. I know that there customer service was great at one time,1,2024-12-20 12:35:20

أسوأ تجربة شراء اونلاين مريت بيها في حياتي ، الشركة بتساعد المندوبين و التجار على عمليات النصب و الاحتيال على العملاء عن طريق ثغرات النظام الفاشلة في التحقق من عمليات التوصيل ، و عند المكالبة بحقك لن تستطيع ان تواجههم ، شهر تقريبا و مش قادر اخد المنتج او اخد فلوسي ، لا انصح بالتعامل معهم ابدا,1,2024-12-20 11:31:03

Wrongfully charging for items. Will not refund the full amount when they mess up. Customer service lies and gives you the run around. This company is turing into a joke. I do not recommend their services. They keep getting worse!,1,2024-12-19 05:30:36

"Sticky app with reviews that do not match the products, etc. Glad I am not a member anymore, not worth the glitches or gouged prices. Same issues, cart says less items than what's in it. Makes it hard to shop and trust your private info with, been a non member for yrs now.",1,2024-12-19 05:05:30
"I don't know if someone at Amazon was lebotomized or what, but lately, the quality of items has gone way down, and the time it takes for them to be delivered has gone way up.

"Waiting to charge until an item is shipped is inconvenient. I ordered something on the 6th of December and got charged on the 18th, nearly 2 weeks later. Do you really think someone is saving money for something they thought they bought two weeks prior? +Shipping and arrival dates are completely inaccurate. I was told January 22nd as an arrival date yesterday and today it's apparently arriving tomorrow. Cancelation of orders is also difficult because of these inaccuracies.",1,2024-12-19 03:53:59
"Amazon isn't reliable. They had a backup but declined my afterpay and blamed it on me to avoid paying the refund for the guaranteed on time delivery date they couldn't keep. When you call customer service, Americans don't even answer the phone. I'm not surprised but I'm so disappointed. I'm cancelling my membership after they ruined my baby girls Christmas.",1,2024-12-19 03:28:39

"I wanted to give feedback about one of your rude driver. I don't know his name as he was very aggressive and rude to me and our property security. However, his vehicle number plate is L-98113, and his co-worker name was Naveed Ullah. Both of them came on 14th December around 5 PM to deliver something, but they were very unprofessional, rude, and arrogant. They even abused me in their language, which I can understand, and it wasn't acceptable. I am sure Amazon will take action against them.",1,2024-12-19 02:25:56

"Why do people love amazon? EVERYTHING I have ordered from them has never been delivered on time. Why pay extra for prime for faster delivery when they still don't deliver on time? Items show delivery date but AFTER you pay the delivery date changes to a later date. It doesn't change once either they'll change the date more and more the closer it gets to the newer delivery dates. Horrible service, horrible greed, horrible owner.

Between the ai garbage, the inability to confirm purchases anymore, the nonexistent support ""team"" if you can even call it that, since there's no human working on it, and the blatant misuse of the application by sellers, you'd be better off going to the store yourself.

"It's a pretty good app. Most sellers are reliable. The one problem that I have with this, and hopefully someone can help me, is that when you apply a giftcard balance, it automatically becomes your default payment method.

12/17/24 - Update to the app makes past/awaiting orders in chronological order even if they haven't been shipped/ delivered. Pending items use to always be at the top of the list. Unnecessary organizational updates. Old review: Needs another update this app is glitchy and lags ALL the time. It's so annoying. I can't tell you how many times I scroll down a list only for it to keep sending me back to were I was or images don't load. Its not my phone since this is the only app that does this.,2,2024-12-17 20:05:02
"Terrible company and what a terrible experience. Prime membership is NOT worth the money. Pay for two day shipping, and everything is late... Then you add the dysfunctional local delivery company contracted by amazon that throws around and damages your packages (there is video evidence). Don't order anything fragile cause it won't make it in one piece.",1,2024-12-17 19:33:35
"I really question the capabilities of the Amazon India investigation team. I ordered a premium blender on Amazon which was ""Amazon delivered"" but ended up getting a cheap table lamp (the package even showed 500 GM). After raising the issue the response I got was that ""the investigation has been completed and we are unable to help you further"". Lesson learnt. Better stick to brick and mortar for expensive items at least in India.",1,2024-12-17 18:57:55

Every so often, I do have to make returns, and sometimes my package or item(s) have been lost or didn't receive, but this can happen with any shopping done online! Customer service 100% of the time has been so helpful to either reordering or refunding me! ALWAYS read the descriptions, dimensions, and return dates!

Pretty over Amazon's BS. They guarantee a package will get delivered in a certain time and then it's just your problem when they can't. My package literally went from shipped to it's delayed and won't be there till tomorrow in less than 5 minutes. Really. Seems like people just don't want to do their job and Amazon doesn't care because they're such a corporate giant. That one person not buying from them anymore won't affect anything.,1,2024-12-17 07:06:48

"Amazon Shopping is very handy and reasonably priced. I usually receive items ordered early or on time. There is no problem returning items that don't fit right or are not as expected.

They are deleting negative reviews while keeping positive ones up, this is CENSORSHIP. I just reviewed the products honestly, no harsh words, just the truth.

Prices are reasonable lots of products but do not use their delivery stations at the convenience stores because when I had a product delivered there they said their own boxes are full so you don't get your product nor do you get your money back until you call them which is almost impossible to make contact with Amazon to get your money back. Then when trying to use texting to make contact they don't let you type out what you want they have options to make it look like it's your fault.,3,2024-12-16 01:24:25
"This rating is not for the app, it's in regards to my recent delivery. Your driver left two custom orders and a parcel containing food out in the rain. They left it in the POURING RAIN. And yes, it was already raining at the time of delivery. To make it worse, they sat it all beside the carport, not under it, beside it. Why??? To top it all off, they said I signed for it. No one knocked at the door, no one rang the doorbell, and they obviously did not even walk to the door. Inexcusable.",1,2024-12-16 01:13:24

Amazon Shopping has been Nothing BUT PROBLEMS for me. Amazon used my backup payment method to charge items which then overdrew my account and added a overpayment charge raising next month's payment to 3 times my monthly payment. My default payment had more then enough money to cover what I spent but for some reason it went to my backup. Wasn't me or my banks fault and Amazon customer service just runs you in circles telling me my bank denied payment. NOT TRUE. IM DONE WITH AMAZON!,1,2024-12-15 21:20:31

Retuning stuff is a nightmare. Customer support couldn't do anything to help. All she did was repeat what she was limited to on her screen. Purolator is nowhere near me. Why is that the only option? Canada Post refused to take my return.,1,2024-12-12 06:34:10
After my first order my account was restricted for multiple violations to the return and refund policy. I never tried to return anything or get a refund. I called and asked why and was left on hold for most of the call then was told it would be fixed in 24 to 48 hours. Over 48 hours later still have the same problem.

This kind of feels like a bait and switch. Is it a bug with the app or did the price jump because I got interested in it.

I know my opinion doesn't count for nothing to Amazon. I also find it funny that an item says hurry only 3 left and days later the count is still at 3",1,2024-12-09 19:48:18

If they paid their drivers a livable wage, my son's Christmas gifts would not have been put in the hands of an outside carrier and destroyed. If Amazon had decent customer service, my son's Christmas gifts could have been put in another box and shipped before Christmas. Now, my Amazon refuses to refund my money before Christmas so I can get my son's gifts elsewhere. Amazon has become the Grinch who stole my son's Christmas.",1,2024-12-08 02:44:16
"Terrible inconsistent app. As Rich as Amazon is they should have a functional app. Constantly changing colors and the ridiculous double to triple times you have to press on an option before it actually goes to it. Searching includes the exact opposite items. Wish lists are a disgrace. I can't find anything in them because it won't keep items in order of the most recent thing to the oldest. Searching the list is useless, enter GPS and every item I KNOW is gps doesn't show up. I hate this app",1,2024-12-08 02:23:41

It is $115 and advertised as including free shipping, streaming service, and the music app. The truth is that you only have free shipping on few items, the streaming service has as many ads as cable TV, and the music streaming doesn't let you listen to music you choose.

Since I closed my credit card on file with them, they can't issue me a refund (although I was told that they were sending a check). I now have to call my bank back for the refund.",1,2024-12-07 04:51:06

After the last update it has become unusable. It's painfully slow and it keeps freezing all the time. Cannot even scroll the lists or the products page. Impossible to complete a purchase.,1,2024-12-07 04:09:23
Don't waste your time paying extra money for fast deliveries because it's still going to be late anyway. And then to get a refund they'll make you wait an extra 7 days. Your best bet is to go to the store and buy what you want right then,1,2024-12-07 04:08:07

I have loved this app. But for some reason it's not letting me select any sizes and not showing me the options either. On some it's only showing me one size. I've clicked on tons of other ones and they still don't give me options. I shop for tons of family members with different sizes. I don't want it to only show me the recommended sizes for me. I want all size options. I'll change my star when this gets fixed!,1,2024-12-07 02:34:58

The sale isn't even for another week and every time I open the app it lags because of the huge banner.

I don't like the update amazon is now spying on our orders. You can't order any clothing for a friend or family member if you have already ordered clothes for yourself. It won't let you change the sizes on anything. So fat people stay fat skiny people stay skinny avg people stay avg because the amazon won't let you change the size. If you already order clothes from them. Amazon now wants to know how much you weigh and how tall you are. Why do they need to know that kind of personal information.,1,2024-12-06 22:32:41

Worst yet is the forced AI that takes up 1/4 the screen and makes viewing searches and information much harder.",1,2024-12-05 00:21:58

Why do I pay for prime when it still takes over a week for shipping?,1,2024-12-04 21:17:12
"The price for a prime membership has not went down, but the service received has decreased significantly! No longer is 2 day prime shipping available. I'm lucky if things show up within a week or more. The price of everything seems skewed, they put a ""sale"" on but it seems the price was jacked up beforehand, and the sale price is just the regular price. Why you wouldn't want to keep your loyal, paying customers happy is beyond me. Prime video, and amazon Alexa both have major issues, too.",1,2024-12-04 21:06:25

"After around 10 years with Amazon (formerly Souq), it's time to stop. Service quality has declined over more than 2 years. Prime orders are late by 2-3 days, delivery associates are rude, and returns are a nightmare—often requiring multiple attempts before a pickup happens. The new ""incident report"" process is meaningless. It took 2 weeks, 3 calls, 6 agents, and 3 emails to get a refund for a late, wrong item. Frustrating experience overall!",1,2024-12-04 19:55:23

I had to start another account just to contact them. Totally unhelpful. account deleted,1,2024-12-01 08:09:36
Amazon delivery actually delivers packages however why dont you inform the customers at check out that you use third party sellers? I dont want royal mail delivering my packages bc they lie about delivering or that they missed us and instead try to get us to collect instead of delivering our package. If amazon is using scummy businesses like royal mail then surely amazon's quality is going downhill. Im done using amazon and will use online services that dont use royal mail.,1,2024-12-01 08:00:34

Decent but flawed. The fact that there is no filter to show me all packages that I haven't received yet is insane to me. That feels like such a common sense filter. Whether or not it's shipped is irrelevant. I just need to know which packages I'm still waiting on regardless of their status. To me this is a huge miss and at Christmas time scrolling through that many orders can be difficult to find the status of everything. Also The return navigation after a refund is cumbersome.,3,2024-11-28 05:13:50

Amazon used to be amazing and quick. Now every delivery is delayed or damaged and you have to fight for a refund.

You might get 1000 results, but when it sorts, there's now only 100. Where'd the others go? I sort this way because two stores will sell the same product and brand, and I just want to buy the cheaper one. 2) There is no place writing the app to voice this feedback. I'm fact, there's no way to make suggest improvements or criticize the app. Ego?",3,2024-11-24 23:05:27

Not as good as it used to be. Prices are on par with other retailers but you have fewer purchase options. You also always pay the shipping even when you have a prime sub. They just increase the base price of the item to cover the shipping.,3,2024-11-24 12:22:17

Garbage sorting system might as well be searching for an item blindfolded.

"Periodically worse and worse customer service from Amazon. When a package is in pre shipment, Amazon considers it shipped. Then when trying to contact the seller about why preshipped packages aren't on the way (1 week later) Amazon redirects you to their AI chat or have you speak with their customer service instead of contacting the seller. The links customer service send you just got to the AI chat. It's like Amazon goes out of the way to keep is from contacting the sellers.",2,2024-11-20 00:36:15

I ordered two items, Amazon charged my account, and Amazon sent me the wrong item. I initiated a return, ""wrong item"" received. I sent the ""wrong item"" back and Amazon sent me the correct one a week later. A month later Amazon is saying I sent them the wrong item and charged my account. Their customer service is a joke. They robbed me.",1,2024-11-16 11:29:25

Have always been pleased with the speed of shipping and the deals however if it takes an extra day or two to ship it in a box rather than as is with the item box I'd prefer that over a $200 purchase sitting on my front porch for 4 hours. Not only that but the item is a gift and they stuck labels all over the box. Very horrible business decisions and I doubt it saved Amazon any more than a nickel.

My package not being delivered while the app claimed it had been delivered 2. Someone else's package being delivered and my product going missing instead 3. Today, package came in my name, but completely different product inside the packaging. This was meant to be a gift for my son :(",1,2024-11-15 00:25:42

Please remove this Rufus assistant. Not only it's useless and no one asked for it. Takes huge part of the screen . Also since this update half of the products can't be displayed with error demanding to refresh product page - where refresh page option is not available in app... How can I find and buy something if half of the time product can't be displayed? So - Rufus - annoying. Errors on product page - renders app unusable.,1,2024-11-14 23:33:47

"Amazon's ""Customer Service"" in the USA has been reduced to a bad joke. I rarely get to speak to someone that I can understand. Their attempt at speaking English while in their noisy environment is rude and using fake common American names is insulting. They do not understand English and cannot resolve issues. Changing where I shop very soon.",1,2024-11-13 04:20:09
I don't even go shopping out in the wild anymore.... why would I when it's all right here!,5,2024-11-13 04:08:20
"I disabled ALL notifications that weren't about shipping and delivery, and I still get daily prompts to make purchases by this app, stop being so pushy, this does not prompt me to make more purchases on Amazon, it does the opposite.",1,2024-11-13 04:00:45

Awful customer service and sell some temu/wish products market. Some purchases can't be e carried out to on app and some returns/refunds will look not be processed regardless of if item was delivered broken or delivered at all,1,2024-11-13 03:48:22

I'm a deliberate user of this app. My account got hacked and a lot of money was taken out of the account. We contacted Amazon's customer service and it's been a month or so and they are completely ignoring our requests to look further into this. I'm severely disappointed in their service and account security level. I hope Amzon will reach and are willing to help me,1,2024-11-13 02:52:30
