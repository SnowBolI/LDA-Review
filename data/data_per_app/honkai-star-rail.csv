"P2w and stingy af, these hoyo devs don't certainly respect or appreciate their user community whatsoever. If they did, they would have given a lot of free SSR units or gacha resources for free just like how NetMarble helps their community",1,2025-06-18 17:13:42

"The game is far too greedy and basic. Having two gacha banners is a terrible move. In addition, the story is poorly written. The characters are, for the most case poorly written and designed.

"it has fun combat, cool characters and music, and a decent story however recently it's been going downhill, whether it be the story with loads of dialogue and no skip button and half the characters not having voice actors, the fact it's nearly impossible to complete endgame content without getting the newest character or how the f2p experience is so much worse now, a year ago I would've given this game 5 stars and I really do love this game I just hope they fix all the issues",1,2025-06-18 11:16:27
no for me war freak 😆,1,2025-06-18 10:05:11
It's a really fun game though unfortunately it does suffer a fair bit from power creep. Older characters just don't do too great compared to the newer ones. Especially in any of the side content but also increasingly in the main story as well. Mostly due to artificially increased difficulty with bosses having increased hp or having to use a specific way or dealing damage that the newest characters are more optimized for.,4,2025-06-18 08:09:55
"This game has gone downhill. It's been so tiresome trying to beat any of the endgame stuff, due to power-creep and needing new characters that I have no interest in. Even the story is having issues. Penacony is where it started getting boring for me. It was nonsensical, obnoxious, and slow. This game had potential, but now, it's just a game to squeeze money out of people.",1,2025-06-18 06:41:37

"imo this game isn't really it for me. the story was boring in the beginning, I didn't really feel connected to the characters, combat isn't my cup of tea. but I will admit that that some characters are pretty. I remember some names. but that's really it for what I think about honkai star rail. this is just my opinion, it's perfectly fine if you have different opinions about the game.",2,2025-06-18 04:40:26

"Gameplay used to be fun. Elemental weaknesses encouraged diverse teams. However, all of that has been scrapped in favor of newer, pay to win, all encompassing units that break the game. Now, the meta units just destroy everything on the field and ignore any mechanics implemented in the past. No strategy needed, no thinking. Dont even try to pull for any of the previous released dps units before 3.0. Story is now a drag. STILL No skip button yet. Cutscenes too short and few. Money Hungry HoYo.",1,2025-06-17 23:59:13
"Story is good but dialogue scenes are so static and boring, forcing players to look at unmoving character models with minimal gestures talking. It was better in v1.0 where dialogue scenes are more expressive. The devs can't give us properly animated dialogue scenes but can always make the powercreep higher, wow. And the characters designs are getting stale, you get a game involving different planets and almost none of that potential is being used, such boring clothing choices.",1,2025-06-17 23:10:20
"This was a great game. Now, at this point, I'm just disappointed by so many things. HP inflation is one of them. There is still no skip button, and the story just became very dull to me.

I used to enjoy this game and spend quite a lot just to catch up. But the game has been going downhill for a while. They keep introducing new overpowered characters as new meta. Older well build characters cannot even finish endgame content consistently. New story has been very weird and confusing. Cutscenes are terrible. Developer never listened to players. I am no longer willing to support this game.,1,2025-06-16 20:25:40

Plus, unnecessary communication is very necessary, so the player understands and learns about that character. They are just hating for no reason. If you don't want to play it, just don't.

Where to start honestly? The character designs and back stories are incredible! The VAs did so good.

"What can I say? Powercreep. It's such a shame, too. This game could have been so amazing! Seriously! It could have been awesome! But instead this game is now a joke to the entire Gacha community, so much so that we now have a fear of intense powercreep the *second* we see a character just a miniscule bit stronger than the last in literally any gacha, and it all stems from this excuse of a game. It's a joke to see how this game has become, and the devs don't even care! They couldn't care less!",1,2025-06-14 02:55:15
"ive been playing since 1.0. Everything about this game is great, except for the powercreep of new characters and hp inflation for endgame boss content that just gets worse by every update, forcing u to pull the newest over powered characters. yes giving buffs for some old characters in an upcoming patch is great, but why does it take that long to just buff certain characters? the story and everything else is perfect, just the problems above make this game more annoying to play in every patch",2,2025-06-14 02:17:32

"HSR: We F2P players are really suffering. The upcoming banner and collab with Saber and Archer are overwhelming. I’m glad Archer is free, but the rerun banners are insanely good, and our limited resources can’t keep up. We grind every single day just to save up, and now we’re forced to choose without even having a say. At least let us pick between Saber and Archer as free unit.

Used to be fun but now it's sadly unbearable. It always has taken a long time to build up your characters which was always a drag but manageable. Unfortunately the storyline has been getting more and more dull with excessive Yap. The animations and characters were very great. The introduction of the global passive sadly is a very bad idea coupled with dreading a new lackluster story to drag through has me leaving. Had a lot of time invested into this game but that's how it goes I suppose. Adios.,3,2025-06-13 04:38:29

It hasn't failed me for a while so i guess im biased about it for not losing any 50/50 ""yet"". Turn based system? To be honest, either you autoplay everything, or have fun doing strategies.

Game doesn't feel the same as it was in the beta and 1.X updates. I miss those days so much. I'm just playing the game because it's Honkai and I loved Honkai Impact 3rd and it's story. That is the reason. Even the YouTuber HomuLabs just plays the game because it's a Honkai game and he doesn't really like the turn based gameplay.

"use to love this game, but it is more about money now and purchases. I bought the 5.99 and the 15.99 honors to support the game but this in game items are less useful now, the the characters drops always give the same and almost impossible to pull a 5 star one. when you spend 2700 crystal and you got one 4 star already owned character you would understand my feelings. playing on ps5 for the insane 80gbs space for the game. also too much minigames now. I would be more happy for story content.",3,2025-06-12 15:37:30
"Played since day 1, and to be fair, the game was never at the masterpiece it's hailed as. The story WAS good. Combat WAS okay if somewhat boring to me. Now, the story decided to derail into this random side plot that if you don't get hyped on the characters from the beginning, it's just boring and corny. The combat has been unbearable with the amount of catering it does to newer characters. I think I'll reserve the 20Gb on my phone for better games.",1,2025-06-12 14:14:15
"I really enjoyed this one for the first year after launch and a little after; but we've reached a point where HP inflation and character powercreep has become abhorrent.

"It had a nice story and art style, but gameplay is a boring turn based system. As expected the enemies are getting power crept in every patch including characters. I was disappointed with the fact that it wasn't an open world game, but I guess every Sci-fi game has to be a semi open world game. Dialogue has gotten even longer in stories, character stories are now just forced into the main ones instead of being a side mission. Not recommended.",1,2025-06-12 08:47:23
Star rail is my favorite game but it takes an unnecessary amount of storage. It was taking 35GB on my phone. I'm sure the devs can think of a better solution for this but so far all our complaints have fallen on deaf ears. 2025 update: the lack of engaging events has made me not want to play as much. it's no longer my fave game. i miss when it was actually good,2,2025-06-12 07:20:03
"this game used to be so fun, but then they started to focus on the player having to spend money, and with characters getting powercreeped, you have no choice but to get characters that are meta. not only this but they have become extremely lazy in every aspect of storytelling, especially the character expression during dialogue. the voice acting is amazing but the empty expression ruins everything and makes it hard to truly invest yourself in the story.",2,2025-06-12 06:53:10

With hoyo releasing two 5 stars every update and no new 4 stars they need to be more powerful so ppl pull for them or something. The bosses have to much hp as well and good luck clearing late end game content if u dont want to spend money. Its rather generous to its players compared to other game i suppose but the only thing that i feel saves it, its the amazing story it offers.",3,2025-06-11 23:54:42
"This game is certainly better than a lot of competitors, but it has drawbacks. The power creep is there. It feels awful to try and get a character you really like only for that character to be outclassed 1 patch later. The enemies in end game content are becoming increasingly difficult with high hp and damage that older characters have a harder time clearing. A lot of characters have useless eidolons, they don't make enough male characters, and they are not f2p friendly with 4 stars. Do better.",4,2025-06-11 21:58:02

"Needs more optimization, it's just going to keep increasing in file size, as well as graphically intensive.

But it doesn't mean anything since the general public's range of phones varies, and even if it's a mid range phone, it might not be powerful enough to do everything even on the lowest settings as time goes on.",3,2025-06-11 10:07:51
"Powercreep, horrible story quest, endless event-less week, this game has been falling since the start of penacony.

"I love the art and visuals, especially the music. I don't get the hate but it's probably bcuz of the power creeps but like it's understandable since it's a turn based game and it's not really open to different playstyles like genshin wise where U can be creative with the way U fight. And the storyline isn't that bad tbh like sure the amphoreus storyline was dragged out but they shortened it during 3.3 so it compromised and balanced it out. I LOVE THE GAME HOYO",5,2025-06-10 12:40:47
"Overall this is a really great game! I really enjoy how hoyo makes so amny different playstyles with a turnbased game. It also has an amazing storyline with a ton of really likeable characters. My only issue with the game is the insane powercreep with not only the characters, but the enemies as well. I feel like they are trying to pretty much make the players spend money in order to just clear content, and it can be really annoying.",4,2025-06-10 12:37:41

"nicee, i love games with minimal effort needed so this is perfect for me. i just need to build good characters then turn on auto mode, and boom, everything's done. the only problem is the powercreep which is actually insane, overpowered characters could be rendered completely useless in just a few patch. it'll be hard for unlucky f2p players to keep up with the meta since we need a total of 180 warps to guarantee ONE limited 5 star",4,2025-06-10 10:42:37

"this game used to be really good and entertaining, but now, its just really a filthy cash-grab. ive spent money from time to time here—more than i've spent on gi/zzz btw—and im still unable to clear majority of the endgame content. comparing to hoyo's others games ive BARELY spent anything and yet i've had no problem clearing content whatsoever. not to mention how dry the events are recently. if you want an entertaining, f2p-friendly game with lively characters, play zzz!",1,2025-06-09 20:34:46

"though the game can be fun I dont always want to talk to the characters and its annoying that if i have to get off then i come back guess what i have to talk to the same character all over again, that and they just talk a lot, the story and characters is nice but it has no incentive for me to ever care about the characters or even come bsck to the area after im done. the characters almost always look nice and the game runs well, i just wish there were a much faster option of communication.",4,2025-06-09 09:01:25

"I feel like this is no longer a game but a visual novel, hell, a story reader. Ever since amphoreus arc, the game has been nothing but myriads of texts about needless story backgrounds, trivias, useless dialogues, it no longer even felt interactive anymore. There is only so much gameplay, why even bother pulling for new characters at this point, you'll probably only be able to use them after eons of dialogue reading, could've sworn I watched my hair turning white waiting for it to finish",1,2025-06-09 05:39:20
I don't understand how this is a million dollar company but you guys put such little effort in the story it's basically just reading a constant wall of dialogue or words on a white/black screen. When there's a cutscene it literally only lasts for a couple seconds and then you're thrown back into reading a wall of dialogue It gets boring and repetitive fast. The designs are literally repetitive and boring too this company likes to constantly just reuse characters from their other games.,1,2025-06-09 03:05:22
"This game was off to a great start, with abundant rewards, an interesting story (in belobog specifically), and pretty tame powercreep. This only lasted up until 2.0, however, with each month presenting a new, much stronger character that, if it was a support, you were forced to buy, if you wanted to keep up with the endgame content. The story went from simple but interesting to convoluted, confusing, only there to waste your time with its endless dialogue. I'd continue, but there's a size limit.",1,2025-06-09 02:48:32

powercreep so hard for this game,1,2025-06-08 02:39:08
I personally thought I'm more on the good side of this. The art and characters are beautiful. But there are power differences for the new characters and the new characters are starting to make the old ones outdated. So update the old characters or nerf the new ones is what I'd say. Plus reduce the lag. For me when I played it on one of the newer phones it sucked like it was really laggy.,4,2025-06-08 01:25:16
"I really love this game as it has a stunning visuals, engaging gameplay, and a compelling storyline. The character design is also exceptional, and the turn-based combat system offers a strategic depth.

"This game can be really difficult for absolutely no reason. There's never enough resources to level the new characters I earn. Some fights are pure hell, like the multiplying bugs.

If this doesn’t get fixed, I’m done with this game — and I know I’m not the only one 😑",1,2025-06-07 07:22:40

Another would be something convenient for certain play styles. Maybe some wouldn't care less about some dialogue, after all—A skip button is really up to the player's decision. That wouldn't hurt a soul either. Lastly, the recent stories (3.0-3.2) haven't been as engaging. I believe a better future ahead for this game.",4,2025-06-06 10:48:33

The system on how to earn jades and all its events are alright but how the newer characters make the old one appear weak sucks",4,2025-06-05 15:34:54
i love this game.,5,2025-06-05 14:31:44
this game has clearly the best plot i have seen in any gacha.atleast the penacony arc. Penacony made me never leave the game even though i left after i started xianzhou,5,2025-06-05 13:07:49

"a game i've really enjoyed since day 1. solid story telling, great characters, and it's a game that works really well on mobile due to its combat mechanics. it's low maintenance and easy to do dailies too. plus, even though it's a little picky, it does support controller input which makes it easier to enjoy the longer story quests since i don't have to hold the phone for hours. The lack of a Mac version is disappointing though.",5,2025-06-05 06:16:26
Pretty good! the first time I downloaded this game it was pink but in the settings u have to go back to normal mode and fully reset the game to actually play it but I don't like the fact u have to find buttons to control the game but other than that pretty good,4,2025-06-05 06:13:39

"damn, what a disappointment! I thought you could do better, HSR! this game is now not recommended, thanks to the global passive, and the dev team not listening to the complaints in the 3.2 live stream! I'm quite done with this game after a year and a quarter of support!",1,2025-06-05 04:22:31

"This game is an utter travesty, honestly. The first act is one of the greatest in a gacha game with great pacing and characters, but that's about where my praises end. It's riddled with powercreep, some of the most boring gameplay I've ever seen in a turn based rpg, a grind so boring they give you an autoplay button and so many anti-player practices that it makes EA look like the most generous company to ever exist.",1,2025-06-05 02:24:54

"Story got boring and uninspiring. NPCs all look the same like bots with just different hairstyles and clothes. And powercreep is so bad it made most of my 5 star pulls from 1.0/2.0 irrelevant.

Can confirm they are much better end products, character, worldbuilding and story wise",1,2025-06-04 23:47:11

And I wanna say to the Review Bombers that once Gautam Budha said-""Expectations are the root cause of all disappointments"" We actually suffer more than in our imaginations.

Edit: Actually it wasn't only on the main quest but on events and side quests also. It's kind of frustrating to not be able to proceed with new updates and all because of the crashing and glitching whenever I navigate quests. Honestly disappointed since I've been having this issue for the past patches. But overall, I do love this game.",3,2025-06-04 23:34:46

"The game is getting worse. The story is too long and boring, with endless back-and-forth dialogue. There is too much power creep with every new character release; Hoyo has forgotten about previous characters and left them to rot. HP inflation is another ongoing issue. I am pretty much only doing dailies and logging out, as I have lost interest, but at this point nope. Event rewards are horrible. The anniversary was a huge disappointment, with poor rewards. A huge issue is the global passive.",1,2025-06-04 10:18:41

"the continuous powercreep is annoying, mainly because it makes me bored in using older characters which are the only ones I have, and the new characters that I don't have have more interesting gameplay which is unfair. The current main quest is kinda boring and I stopped doing it because it's quite long. overall a 5 star if it weren't for the powercreep... and also the lack of new four star characters is notable.",3,2025-06-04 08:32:49

YES, you may need the newer banner characters for the end game mode ( depending on how your team is built), but if you build your characters correctly you can get through the story portion with almost any of them ( there are a few 4* characters ( Arlan being 1 ) that are useless. As for building characters, once you get far enough ( main used characters at max build) you can concentrate on farming for the next banner character",5,2025-06-03 20:41:56

"Came back from a break to realize the characters I had pulled right before quitting were significantly weaker than the new units. The power creep is too much in my opinion. I understand it happens in gacha games especially, but the speed at which they made once-relevant units less relevant was too fast. This will make people no longer want to spend money out of fear of their new units getting power crept when a newer one comes out.",1,2025-06-03 11:52:47
Stop powercreeping characters. At least make them powerful enough to clear content. Stop BRINGING Global passives if the OLDER CHARACTERS DON'T HAVE IT. I don't want to pull new characters. I don't like every patch if the META is constantly shifting.,1,2025-06-03 11:46:23

It's easy to farm, the four stars, (at least to me) in my opinion are equally, if not more powered when you know how to use relics and planar systems correctly. It's easy to farm for gems/tickets to pull without paying, and it's pretty generous with rewards.",5,2025-06-03 09:50:32

Powercreep is insane - 1.x characters are all trash by the end of 2.x Combat becoming boring - multiple new characters can just ignore weakness type which make the combat brainless.

not really a game anymore 😕 just a visual novel you have to voice yourself as of late since all the VAs have been assassinated.

"To HOYOVERSE Team and Developers I Love the Game itself; The story, the gameplay, the various mini games and the idea behind of the mini games which It kills the repetitive battles, grinds hence brings more vibrant to the game; More fun and surprises.

"Power creep made the entire game before 2.0 absolutely redundant. And every character in the banner is a 5 star effectively reducing the number of new 4 stars, effectively making the game now purely p2w and to just progress the game you NEED the new characters or you will get stuck behind the well disguised pay wall. Play this only if you love you ruin your life in casinos.",1,2025-06-01 12:08:01
"Adding global passive is such a horrible idea. I'm already so tired of powercreep and now this happens. Not to mention that there's a drought of 4 stars, companion quests and events.

Combat is turn based and strategic in that, you need to have the right teams and that too, built properly. Update: Biggest let down is, unless you spend money, you cannot be a long term player. Even with the free jades you collect, they will trick you and give you a regular 5*, when you are pulling a special 5*. Also solid game content is less.",3,2025-06-01 00:18:42

"HSR definitely has issues with power creep, but that's pretty standard for a successful, free-to-play gacha game going into its third year. I spend $15/month for the monthly pass and battle pass and can clear the most difficult content with full completion. As a 100% free-to-play account, you might struggle a little, but the game definitely doesn't require spending a ton of money to beat the hardest content. Giving an extra star to compensate for all the people whining about the global passive.",5,2025-05-28 10:22:42
"came for the gorgeous characters, story and world. left because of the power creep.",2,2025-05-28 10:21:01
"old characters feel useless nowadays because every banner and new character release they are so Over powered compared to old characters,I suggested to buff or Remodel the old characters skills to catch up for to the new characters , and also the anniversary is trash it's not much rewards and also no free 5 star character in anniversary",1,2025-05-28 09:42:41
"power creep isn't even ""Creep"" almost every new character destroys the character before it, and why no 4 stars??????? only 5 stars????? hoyo is smoking meth on this game, and not in a good way.",1,2025-05-28 09:18:54
"This game is great. Sure it has its flaws like the recent global passive incident, but it does not deserve such a low rating. The Devs have started to buff old characters that were being power crept for long so that they become relevant in future teams. With the recent version, the boss battles and cutscenes were beautiful, and the music was fabulous. Everyone makes mistakes, and they should be forgiven this time. If you are a new player reading this, I highly encourage you to play this game.",5,2025-05-28 07:49:41
"You can not skip cutscenes/dialogues which take hours to get through. You can not jump, and the biggest negative: You can not buy tons of/infinite stamina. It takes forever to max out just one of the many characters since you are heavily limited with how little stamina the game allows you to have",4,2025-05-28 07:44:52
"the size of this game is unreal, 30gig for a mobile game is not okay",1,2025-05-28 07:04:02
"Actually goated game. The power creep is literally insane though. I can't enjoy a character without knowing that the next banner will have someone better. Can you make like one patch where the new people are just garbage?- Like c'mon, stop adding so much damn power creep for the money.",4,2025-05-28 06:12:26
"been playing this since day 1 and it was fun in the beginning, storyline, gaming, farming, but lately it's been such a drag going through the stories and you can't even skip, gacha itself is tedious especially when it's already hard getting the heroes you wanted, farming for relics, traces materials is becoming like working and it's taking too much of time, energy recovery is even slower, have to wait at least 2 days to have 300 energies. they need to start improving as I have stopped paying",2,2025-05-28 05:04:26
"I used to love this game. I had a strong team build. But after I took a small break from the game, my team or any character isn't viable anymore. I tried many ways to make my DPS usable.

I really like this versions banner and story but the event was just so time consuming and takes a lot of time just to finish one section. i could've done more things than spending at least 10+ minutes on one section of the event,3,2025-05-28 03:58:44

"I like the designs of the characters, even if they make flour look like the color black in comparison to their skintones. Stories are honestly great, and they're working to finally fix the powercreep issue. Screw the meta, people care too much about the damage outcome that they forget to just have fun. The games honestly been super fun, and the story in amphoreous improves gradually the further you get in (i know its tedious at first, but i shed a tear towards the end of the update.)",4,2025-05-28 03:12:57
"Boring unskippable story. You like a character? You need another 2 characters from different limited banners to use it properly! Oh, the old characters you pulled? Forget about them, here's the upgraded version of them in our newest character! Their solution? Increase boss HP to millions. How lazy. The powercreep here is insane. Denial people should look at the dps calculations. Its rly disheartening to have pulled E2 dps to be irrelevant in just few patches. Misleading rates and price for pulls",1,2025-05-28 00:34:15
"Games like these are the reason why people are forced to pull for meta characters, this game used to be a passion project but now it's just a money making factory atp. like why I can't play himeko? because the end game and final bosses all require special Mechanism (yk what I'm talking about) like at least give proper buff to old characters as well. just giving free rewards won't make ur game better, try to actually improve it rather than seeking short them fixing methods",5,2025-05-28 00:11:12
"I've spent a lot of time and money into this game, but as I had taken a break there were PILES of stories for me to do that takes centuries to even get a dam. quarter through and the reward at the end is lackluster (coming from a dialoge skipper) normally I get at least decent rewards after the story like (sometimes) in genshin. I'd recommend this game if you're very into the lore/story, if you just want to see cool characters I wouldn't recommend. beautiful game though, runs smooth too.",3,2025-05-27 23:53:24

"This game is hopeless, E0 new characters is more powerful than E6 characters from previous patch. What the point pulling new characters if next characters going to be powerful than previous one? Plus, there are rarely new 4 star characters for F2P players. This game better change into a visual novel game because every story is too long, it took my entire day off just to clear one story quest (I can only play during my day off and I waste it for those useless dialogue, I feel bad for myself)",1,2025-05-27 12:33:12

Gamesir and 8bitdo also work just fine on mobile aside from HSR. Shame this game won't have a chance to shine due to poor support for android.",1,2025-05-27 08:04:15
"Amphoreus patch has botched the HSR story. Till Penacony, story had dark tinge and fewer death, but it was enjoyable. Single sacrifice of Capitano in Genshin had more emotional impact than current patch. Killing all the characters would oly leave bad taste, rather than a memorable moment. HSR - Ampho is basically budget Game of thrones. if not this game would definitely get 4-4.5 stars.",1,2025-05-27 04:32:28

"The Amphoreus Storyline (The Main Story of 3.X) is so good I can't even put it into words.. like it's beyond good, better than the best. The world building is one of the best. The Amphoreus Storyline is on par with Genshin's (A game developed by the same company) Storyline. HSR (Honkai Star Rail) is probably the best game Hoyoverse has developed, with Genshin second. The character designs are peak. HSR has more better-looking characters in (my opinion) than Genshin.",5,2025-05-26 21:31:33

"powercreep is a very big issue in this game: the value of old characters who were once dominating this game are mostly unusable now combined with the inflation of the enemies' hp; and the story overall seems lazy and boring, paired up with the fact that we as a player has to sit through them without the option to skip it: not everyone cares about the story, especially when there are so many of them that are most likely irrelevant to the main quest",1,2025-05-26 20:59:42

"Honkai, as a game, has both a lot going for it and going against it. I'll get through the bad first because a lot of it boils down to things that stem from it being a Gacha game. Being free to play, whille doable, is a rough grind and often times can be a bit of a slog, especially doing the massive backlog of request you end up with. However, Honkai, as far as story and mechanically, is pretty soild, and I think it is a pretty good casual game to play in intervals.",4,2025-05-26 20:16:14
This game is by far one of the best games made by hoyo. I have been playing this game from nearly it's start and so far l haven't been once bored of it's with constant updates and new contents by hoyo making for players and giving players new things to explore. It's both F2P and P2W game . Although it's a gacha game the game has been constantly giving resources to players . It's prwer systems for characters is also amazing . Overall it is a great game and will be one of my favorite games.,5,2025-05-26 19:38:07

They always giving us free resources to rolling new characters. People who give low rating are just salty and ungrateful.,5,2025-05-26 10:17:35

"The game itself is good and has clearly been developed with a lot of love for the project. However, the powercreep has gotten very bad as of late, rapidly making characters obsolete and making you feel like you need to pull for all the new ones. You will have difficulty clearing even just the main story with older characters, not to mention the game's other modes that highly favor newer characters. I uninstalled because it started to feel bad and I didn't want to end up spending hundreds",3,2025-05-26 02:55:46
"It's been a good ride, but I can not forgive the recent choices made with the state of this game. the most recent story in 3.3 is probably the best they've done in a while. However, despite being story driven, the story is way too bloated in many areas that it doesn't have to be, those can be cut down and still have a great narrative experience because the story has interesting concepts that are hard to appreciate when the story telling is boring. as for characters? pull the new unit or suffer.",1,2025-05-26 02:43:34
"Edit: This game is literaly lying about in-game prices and chances for pulls, avoid like the plague new players! Great gameplay wise but at the end of the day it's gatcha garbage.

"This is a game for children. Story lines are extremely basic, low effort, and predictable. The humor is meant for tiktok kids as well, and even they get sick of the same jokes after a while. As a Gacha it's also very unfriendly in the fact that it has some of the strongest dupes in the market, while also costing the most to obtain. You'd think that would stop powercreep but its actually the opposite. Your $2000 character is trash in comparison to the $2000 character released 2 months later.",2,2025-05-26 01:36:31

Do not expect to get most characters through the gacha without spending. New events feel stiff, soulless and lack the charm of older ones. Obtaining upgrade mats and equipment will be your life.

Side quests are entertaining and NPCs have their own interesting lore. i am an avid open world player, getting used to the turn based battles took some time but is extremely fun, especially with Hertz and Himeko on the same team. I really recommend this game ^^",5,2025-05-25 04:45:03
"since i played longer i realize its not that bad its actually good the only problem is the powercreep thingy happening in this game but tbh the story is godwell written edit: please add a skip dialogue im so sick of it, too much yapping",2,2025-05-25 03:53:07
"1.0 player. I am beyond heartbroken they replaced the EN VA for Caelus and Stelle. I didn't mind waiting until they were able to record their lines for the game and now I have no desire to actually play it anymore, which hurts so much more because of how much I loved the game. The story, music, characters were amazing, their voice actors gave them something even more unique for them and now I feel like that's all gone. It is still a gacha after all, there's definitely power creep happening too.",2,2025-05-25 03:44:16
"Incredibly great game! So glad to be able to finally play with my husband Otto! Don't listen to negative reviews, they're salty they can't skip the story in a story-driven game (and they should play something else)",5,2025-05-25 03:37:41
"The game is very p2w, you can't clear content without pulling the best characters and they force you to pull other characters to support your favourite characters, you can't play without one or the other.

"The Game Looks Good and Sounds Good, but it's held back by a bloated story and predatory monetization. The gameplay is literally just 'buy/summon the new characters' cause powercreep is so egregious even the story/grinding is balanced toward whatever character is the flavor of the week.",1,2025-05-25 02:58:14

"I played HSR for the characters I loved. But with each new banner, power creep made them feel irrelevant. Bosses scale to new units, and my old favorites get left behind. It’s disheartening watching them gather dust, replaced by the next meta. So like them, I’m setting the game aside.

"It used to be fun game where every character can be played now it's all about new character and old character can be thrown away. Secondly, the new story is the worst story ever. If it's even had skip button without a second I click it. And the worst part is the event. Imagine now MOC is focus on new character but event to get the gems is low and not enough.

"Played since launch. The game is so bad now i wouldn't recommend anyone to play. Insane powercreep, hp inflation, losing 50\50 is an actual punishment in this game, all the standard 5 stars are unuseable. Don't even mention 4 stars, the devs pretty much stop making them, and almost all 4 stars are useless except for a couple. Every single 5 star needs their signature to even be viable.

"Loving HSR. played since day 1. It's perfect for casual busy players. e.g. events can clear fast + main story = 1 new one only abt 3-4 hours/ 6 week patch. Needs some reading ingame + homework for team building. Not for people who dislike visual novels/ reading or strategising, as gameplay is turn based not live reaction whacking. There's a lot of references to all sorts, so it's fun. Only issue is powercreep but devs aware. see how they fix/ go forward with it.",4,2025-05-24 14:49:53

"i've loved this game and played since release, but i cannot manage anymore with the combat difficulties. main story bosses are too difficult which removes story immersion, and the game is stuck between a rock and a hard place with 4 stars. as an f2p, i can't even complete the last of theendgame content because my characters, no matter how much i've built them, cannot defeat the enemies fast enough. please make a feature to lower equilibrium levels so people can complete story content easier.",3,2025-05-23 03:10:19
"Day 1 Player here and I just wanted to say that I love this game, it has amazing characters you can't help but fall in love with, beautiful animations during combat and a strong story that leaves you wanting more. If you're curious to give this game a try, I feel it's worth the chance and if it's not for you that's completely fine, I feel the amount of negative reviews are unessecary.",5,2025-05-23 02:31:07
"They added a global passive character that can revive the dead which is insane. HP inflation is through the roof. You basically have to pull every new character to clear the content or spend abhorrent amounts of time and resources on an older character. Oh yeah- AND THEY REPLACED THE MC VOICE ACTORS. This game has honestly gone downhill. A year ago I woulda given it a 4, two year I woulda given it a 5. But right now? I can't give it anything above a 1.",1,2025-05-23 02:13:29

Your character will be outshadow by newer meta charcter within 2-4 patch??? Like phainon power creep castorice which is an anniversary unit? The entire game is very predatory as they keep releasing new character every patch unlike genhin.

"3.3 story wise is a step in the right direction. Long but well written. This patches story is the best written hsr story objectively. There's finally stakes at play, and it is fast-paced. As long as the story is written with actual meaning and not meant to bloat the dialog, it'll be great. Allowing players to skip boring bits in the story was the right move. Hopefully, the next patch is also written well. 3 stars(up from 1). The game still needs balance though.... Gameplay wise at least",3,2025-05-23 00:52:20

Fixing HP Inflation is important cuz u need to make things competitive but not for older characters, like Super Break times having a hard time because Toughness are a lot bigger for enemies in newer patches which is not good.

"I used to love HSR. I've been playing it since day 1 and have enjoyed it over the years. However in the past 6 months the game has unfortunately dropped in quality considerably. Firstly it just feels much more laggy, often unable to start and having constant heavy frame drops during combat. Second the story feels extremely dragged out, now filled with endless yap & no skip. Third the HP inflation and power creep of the last 4 or so patches makes most older characters irrelevant. Boo.",2,2025-05-22 18:18:24

"Such an experience, if I can only re-experience playing such a masterpiece from the beginning. Penacony and Amphoreus are the highest peak of this game. The amount of vibe and feel you get whenever you're in these places and experience the world's story is unbelievably so dystopian. For me atleast. If you're into a game that isn't really that competative. This is the best game for you. Other than the issues like RNG on both banner and the relic main/sub stat system. It's an OVERALL 8.2/10.",5,2025-05-22 13:02:17

Half the content takes place in a Chinese spaceship that feels more like a side story than main content.",1,2025-05-21 18:15:33
game has a huge notable powercreep that just leaves me unmotivated to play the game. catered to whales. Only reason why I'm sticking around is for FGO collab and then I'm gone.,1,2025-05-21 18:15:11

"With recent banner releases it is clear that the company is completely out of original ideas for their kit designs. Powercreep is out of control (just as you should expect from any gacha game) with multiple limited banner characters being outright replaced by new characters with the same abilities but better. I can't really recommend it anymore, unless you are purely playing it for the story (which is pretty good, especially for a gacha game). Both stars are given for that alone.",2,2025-05-21 15:34:10

"Я глубоко разочарована решением о замене актёров озвучивания Первопроходцев на английском языке. В игре и так в последнее время было много проблем. 8 версий в мире, который почти не имеет отношение ко вселенной игры. 4* персонажи исчезли как вид. Каждый новый персонаж требует команду из других новых 5* персонажей. И даже эти новые персонажи будут бесполезны меньше чем через год из-за паверкрипа. Замена актёров главных героев стала последней каплей. Это больше не та игра, которую я любила.",1,2025-05-21 14:42:32
"Used to be a great game, now is a soulless money grab. Story is boring and infuriating. New characters require other new 5 stars to be playable. Events are not as rewarding. 4 stars do not exist.",1,2025-05-21 14:38:02

"This game is pretty fun. Although, there is a clear lack of four star characters. The exp gains is like a rollercoaster, so I guess the game just wants the player to get new and strong characters, build them up and defeat the end games. But, most characters from the earlier versions(1.0) are clearly lacking in strength compared to those in after Versions (2.0 - 3.2), so I hope they won't do power creep so often. Bring more four stars!",5,2025-05-21 13:52:15
"I do like the designs but everything else?? it's very hard to build characters, also apparently they recast both of the trailblazers.

"Day 1 player here. I absolutely loved this game when it came out, and from 1.0 to 2.0, this game was magical, even with it's bumps here and there. It was honestly a 5* game. Ever since 2.1 this game has slowly become a big slog to me, both gameplay wise and story/character wise. Stopped playing with 3.0 when I tried to weather the storm thinking Amphoreus would be a change of scenery and pace. But with so much recasting and needing new characters, it is just unfun.",1,2025-05-21 11:18:59
"Fun gameplay, great character design. But the story feels very slow because of the continous yapping that sometimes makes it feel like it is being extended only to retain players longer. There is also a serious problem of powercreep with old characters like Seele. Which needs an extreme environment and stats to work.",2,2025-05-21 11:17:53
"it was peak at some points of the main story, though for Amphoreus, as much as I love the quests tailored on specific characters, it does seem unnecessary since that Tribbie's past was revealed only to make krateros to understand the history and it can be overwhelming to complete the quests, there's also immense powercreep, I am an invested player and it took me so many tries to complete the MOC 3.1 and I was never able to defeat it within 10 cycles after that attempt, tho their designs rock",3,2025-05-21 11:08:27

"My favorite aspect of this game is the combat system. It touches all my favorite preferences for turn-based combat with a unique system scarcely seen elsewhere. The story is great as well if you can get past the first section of the Loufu (bit of a drag). Story used to peek in Belabog, but the peek is Penacony now imo. Highly recommend! As far as P2W vs F2P goes, getting characters obviously makes the late game content vastly easier, but is not necessary for normal gameplay at all. F2P friendly!",5,2025-05-21 10:59:45
"I really really love this game, I've always had my eye on it ever since pre-registration, the story is good, the characters are awesome and well written. The problem is that there's little to no 4 stars and most of them are trash. The powercreep is INSANE. New 5 stars just fall off after about 4 patches or so + sometimes you need to get their signature lightcone in order for them to actually work. It feels like a pay to win game atp. Maybe fix the powercreep issue and add more USEFUL 4 stars.",2,2025-05-21 10:57:35

"The power creep is insane. They lost their way. Used to be fun, but honestly not worth time investment. Game is predatory with endgame content geared only towards newer units, you used to be able to use diverse teams and build for fun to clear but now it requires you to always pull for the latest banner and risk losing a 50/50 and just having to skip banners.

from my personal experince this is one of the better gacha games that care more about the game then the money(only rivaled by wuwa) you can essentially get more than 1 five star every patch if you put effort into the game. the most recent patch amphoreus is definitely worth playing and the characters are very well written,5,2025-05-21 09:26:43

Better than genshin impact and and a much better fanbase too (thank God)! It's clear that the devs care about the game and listen to player feedback! Very fun and runs well on most devices!

It's not terrible but it's nowhere near as peak as it once was,3,2025-05-21 08:53:58
"despite what others say and the inclusion of Castorice global passive. It's still a fun game and the powercreep isn't as bad as they make it out to be, the main story you can goof around In and even an idiot like me can make half decent teams, the story fun aswell, it's got decent jokes, community memes, callbacks to past events and it's interesting. Much better than other free Gacha games on the app store.",5,2025-05-21 08:53:37
"Add a skip button. The story and dialogue has way too many yapping moments that sometimes isn't even relevant to what's happening.

I love this game and been playing sense release. wish I could give it 5 stars but some of the complaints from the lower ratings are pretty valid. power creep is pretty harsh and this is coming from a spender who likes to collect characters but not spend so much to max eidolons. the global passive is a op mechanic and I personally hope they aren't going to make that a common thing. story is definitely meh. more time locked in conversations and idle chatter then actual trailblazing,4,2025-05-21 08:22:57

"1.0 player here. I'm changing my review of this game since many of the aspects I loved about this game is being abandoned. - The storytelling is becoming convoluted with much of the elements feeling dragged on with little payoff. - The relevency of older characters are diminished, meaning that making long-term investments on characters feel wasted. - The lack of new combat events and modes means that the only end-game combat is limited to a mode that refreshes every 2 weeks. Go elsewhere.",1,2025-05-21 08:10:06
"I know there is an issue about the power creep characters but overall, I have been playing this game from day 1 and I still absolutely love it.",5,2025-05-21 08:09:11

Still my favorite game. Loving all the Amphoreus characters 🥰,5,2025-05-21 08:00:31
"I love this game but I can't support them anymore. Their treatment of the voice acting cast has forced my hand and I can no longer support the company. Star rail was home to some of the most talented English dubbed voice actors I've ever seen, and now it's a game full of scab actors. Fix this and maybe I'll care again :(",1,2025-05-21 08:00:30

"Day 1 F2P player here. it's sad and frustrating to see the lack of 4-star characters, companion missions, patch limited events getting reduced to one sitting when playing it. the main trailblaze mission is the only thing that is taken seriously, amphorous storyline is great, but other than that, everything else is halfhearted with the sole intention of money grab via 5-star powercreep",1,2025-05-21 07:44:34
"it a simple fun turn base game if you ignore the gacha part. yes the powercreap is crazy here so you always need to pull new character the story is mix, there is good and bad, but the way story deliver is so bad. can't skip dialog, to many yapping and fetch quest. at least Stelle was fun character",3,2025-05-21 07:42:45

"People have been Reviewing bombing since Castorice's Banner, where they introduced Global Passives. In all my hours and hours of playing since her release, I have NEVER had to use the passive on a BUILT team. Castorice's Passive isn't the problem. People's teams are. Know HOW to play the game, and you'll clear the content. There are PLENTY of standards only and 4* only character clears, and all these 1* reviews ignore. You still can clear the endgame, if YOU'RE SMART! Be smart, build smart.",5,2025-05-21 07:35:24
"skip button please, your story is too long and not fun",1,2025-05-21 07:31:51
"a fun game overall, but lacking in 4* characters in recent patches. characters practically never seem to wear actual clothes, but rather some fabric & metal amalgamations that, looking at the cosplayers, would be a chore to don or doff. gameplay loop is nice enough, story is enjoyable, though some lines are too spread out with no need for the dramatic delay. enjoyable as a game to play on the side, now and then.",3,2025-05-21 07:30:13

"Don't believe the review bombers - this game is still great! It is a gacha, and the character strengths are bound to always change and evolve into stronger and better capabilities as the game gets older. The company wants to make money, but they've made a game that can be free to play if you're not character hungry. It just takes time and effort. WORTH IT!!!! The art design and sound design are fantastic, and I still cannot believe I'm not paying a monthly subscription just to be able to play.",4,2025-05-21 07:04:27
"I absolutely love this game. I used to play Genshin, but quit because it felt endless for farming for one character. Instead, Star Rail is very free-to-play friendly. The stories are long, often several hours, like most story driven games, but are often very eventful. You can easily stop the story gameplay, since waypoints are unlocked just by being in close proximity. I absolutely love the stories and characters, as well as the different character mechanics.",5,2025-05-21 07:00:31

But in the latest updates in MOC, bosses have too much HP and almost seem to be unbeatable for my characters, especially in the older versions.

"My issue that I have on this game is how stale the story telling is. I hate how the amphoreus story is actually interesting (for me), but it gets boring when the only thing u see is the character model turning around..? sometimes no movement at all. Dont get me started on black screens and it changed into white screens when the first time i saw it I laughed tbh. I dont wnt to compare but if u guys can do interesting way to tell a story on your other games surely you can also do it in hsr.",1,2025-05-21 06:01:36
"animations are beautiful, and the storyline is absolutely amazing. Only giving it four stars because of how phones that are maybe like 1 or 2 years old makes it really laggy.

"the game itself is good, but the lack of skippability is what sucks, long bouts of dialogue and constant tapping, not to mention the sponginess of the bosses in the Divergent Universe as well and the Simulated Universe too, most bosses need atleast a long while to be chipped away at and then they hit you with the Berserk powerup, the anniversary was alright. but a spending one at that, it was geared towards whales and not the f2p individuals not to mention the abysmal drop rates for characters",3,2025-05-21 05:49:41

"Easier to play on mobile than other fully-3D gacha games I've tried because it's nearly all turn-based - except some events and such. And there aren't the platforming elements of a fully open-world game (I'd call it partially open-world) which is also nice on a tablet/phone. The plot/dialogue options have a lot of goofiness, which I like, but can be quite serious when needed.",5,2025-05-21 05:37:21
iam here talking about my experience. MINE. I enjoyed the game alot every since I joined in 1.2 and getting kafka first try. The turn based game which I like cause I played like buddyfight if you people don't know what the hell that is search it up and pokemon which I wouldn't say it's turn based but to me it is either way it's complicated to explain the lore is superb. Peak. and the gameplay is sooooo cool to me. the fighting scenes during the quest is like watching a from a 4k TV . game 100/10,5,2025-05-21 05:35:22

"NEWBIE TIP: If you're new to this game like I was, research good characters first. You get quite a few free options when you first start, and it helps further down the road. Wish I had done that... I got this game on a whim out of pure boredom just because I heard it mentioned one time in passing, I did not expect to get a full blown engaging story on par with a triple A title. Has a well thought out and engaging story with pretty decent twists and great lore imo. 10/10, also F2P friendly.",5,2025-05-21 05:31:40

"The gameplay and animations are really satisfying, but some team archetypes require specific characters who might not even be on banner. The story feels very boring at times, and unless you make through the boring parts it becomes extremely confusing. Also I feel like a lot of the lore shouldnt be locked behind reading entries, especially if they are relevant to the story. Also the ost, while not bad, feels very bland when compared to other hoyoverse games :/ honestly a little disappointing",3,2025-05-21 05:09:13

"Gotta edit and knock my rating down. I used to love this game. Defended it to the bones despite it being a hoyoverse game. Now, it feels BLOATED. There is the most insane push to rush story. I can hardly clear any content despite having fully built and maxed characters (even looking up guides for builds and teams...), and the side content (that you need 2 do 4 currency) is needlessly over convoluted, time consuming, and just an unreadable word salad overall. I miss my Boothill. :(",2,2025-05-21 01:47:15
"I have been playing this game since two months after it came out, and I can say that it doesn't deserve so many one-star ratings. I agree that they need to provide more 4 star characters, and it's been too long since the last one. I also don't like the decision to create a reward system for spending money. However, the story/characters in this game are phonemenal, the gameplay is clean, and design is amazing. One of the few mobile games I've stuck with",5,2025-05-21 01:44:33

There's the usual grind but auto-battling makes up for it imo. I like going off to do chores while feeling like I'm still ""playing"" the game.

"The game it self is amazing, but just like other low rating review, what we all hate is how direction of the game lead to. Every single character become irrelevant and powercrepct on next 3 to 4 patch, and because how strong and inflated newest boss become, its impossible for old character to defeat them.

"Started off as a promising game with beautiful visuals and fun mechanics, but it's been going downhill fast. The biggest issue now is powercreep — every new banner feels like it makes older characters useless, which kills the motivation to invest in them. The story used to be interesting, but now it feels dragged out and dull. Long, drawn-out dialogues with no skip option make it worse. Sometimes it feels like I'm watching a never-ending cutscene rather than playing a game.",1,2025-05-20 10:28:27

where's the skip button? used to be good but now story it takes too long and boring. HP inflation is crazy and lots of characters need buffs. Maybe this game will die earlier than genshin,1,2025-05-20 03:23:29
"Been playing since release and currently taking a hiatus as farming and building characters usually take months (mostly for relics), only for them to get powercreeped in a few or the next patch so you need the new character is just not healthy for the game. They are going to buff older characters but there's no way to tell how it'll affect the game until they come out.",1,2025-05-20 02:25:16
"As someone with more hours in this game than probably any of the 5 star reviews this game has been on a downwards slope since Amphoreus. Power creep, boring character designs (gameplay wise), horrible story telling, and there's still no way to skip the hours of word slop.

"edit May 18, 2025: Incredibly grindy and the story is good at times but is more like a visual novel (black screen with text and over explaining). The global passive is also not a good precedent to set. Game is decent if you play casually. old: Turn based, fun. It's bit grindy once you reach higher levels and it's also gacha which isn't great. Fairly friendly to F2P though and the world feels immersive and alive. Can get a bit tiring to read dialogue but the combat is incredible and story good.",3,2025-05-18 14:12:57

Just hard to defend this game anymore. Building characters is a grind and can take weeks to finish one character. 65% of the roster just can't compete with the new content. They stopped making 4 star characters and maybe 2 are still viable. The story is a just all text as of late and pretty bland. This game needs serious help.,1,2025-05-18 08:03:31

"They have added a character that can revive your entire team even if she herself isn't on the team. There's only one event per patch and it lasts 30 minutes at most. The last four star character came out in September 2024. Every patch they add two five stars and every DPS is stronger than the last.

"I love HSR. I've dabbled in all of the Hoyoverse games, but this one really stole my attention. Great story, characters, graphics, gameplay, sound design, music, yada yada. Yeah, it gets a bit grindy late-game. Yeah, the power creep is getting crazy. Yeah, the black screens can be annoying. But I push all of that aside because I like the game for what it is. The presentation may not be perfect, but the story in HSR is amazing, and that is always what will keep me coming back.",5,2025-05-15 20:11:50

"The game was fun for quite a while, but the artifact system that they used from genshin killed this game since every battle is just a stats test, even story content is too difficult and there isn't much of a way to play better, unless you pull the new op five star which does what all your old five stars can do just better. This is avoiding the global passive discussion. I don't think I can recommend",2,2025-05-15 18:14:32

I'd give a 5* for Hyacine and Ica but I have to stay honest. The story has sadly downgraded a little. There's long quests so do it in multiple sittings, cast are.. ok.

"Day 1 player here, I used to love the game but I'm starting to get fed up with the direction the game is going. Characters are cool but powercrept too quickly, after ~3-4 patches they fall off in damage, unless you're willing to pull for eidolons, their signature light cone (weapon) and/or their BiS teammates. Current story quest is very long with no skip dialogue button but a lot of yap. 2nd Anniv was a spending event thrown into your face. More issues but no more room to type.",2,2025-05-14 23:01:50
"Developers do not listen to players, they add predatory and toxic changes that the community is against just to sell the new characters.

"A tragic shell of what it once was. There was plenty to love about Star Rail when it first released. As time went on instead of adding features to make the gameplay less shallow and mind numbing, it's once again a solemn tale of yet another gacha making its money and then opening the floodgates for game breaking characters.

It takes forever to build 1 character. The artifacts (which is used to make your characters do more damage) is so RNG based that it's literally impossible to build them unless you plan on spending thousands of dollars on this game.

"Edited from patch 3.1: This game is the best RPG i've ever played. It has rich storyline and amazing worldbuilding. Been hooked since its release. However, since then, the powercreep is crazy.

"- Lack of enticing and fun events with the next patch only having 2 major ones - Unbearable power creep that demands high investment in characters only to have them fall off from massive HP inflation - Alright story but awful storytelling with a lack of character movement, expression, and cutscenes alongside drawn-out dialogue and tell-not-show problem Impressive to see how much this game has declined since its first anniversary, and especially in the beginning",1,2025-05-11 04:27:05

You see the comparison when you need 2 teams - Castorice and another. While Castorice not giving a damn, I could put 4 carries in a team and they wouldn't make it.

"Honkai Star Rail was the best game for me when I started playing it, its been 2 years since it release and for all that ive done in the game is pretty much time spending. Now the reason why I gave it a 1* review is that the game evolved backwards, the story is longer than my own lifespan, and you cant clear content with old characters anymore. and for its anniversary just a spending event and some events to thats just not interesting...

The dialogue between characters is so unnecessarily bloated that simple talks turn into hours of pointless yapping. The story itself is a mess, where no planets are truly interconnected, and to this day, there is no central villain to begin with. Powercreep and HP inflation is essentially out of control and future units have QoL features locked behind Eidolons, a literal paywall.",1,2025-05-10 05:15:27

Download it, trust Update: still good, just sucks everyone got bored of it, I take long breaks, but I always come back. It's good, just doesn't have much content after you explore everything. Just like genshin. But there's a tonnn on content on genshin, and honkai has less, obviously. UPDATE: temp 1 star cus not f2p friendly",1,2025-05-10 03:31:29

"Investing in your favorite characters is useless because they get powercrept with the next new character released. They just want you to keep spending money and pull new characters that you don't even like. They go out of their way to make sure you can't use your old teams that you invested a lot of time and money to build. And because that's not enough, if you want to play just for the story, don't bother. Nothing in the story makes sense and is boring.",5,2025-05-09 18:29:37

"5*s to 2*s. Peaked at Belobog, then went downhill with too much powercreep and bloated dialogue (Penacony was my last straw). Stopped playing cause the game could forever add crazy concepts to the poorly exposited lore before reaching an ending—whatever that is. At least Genshin has harder worldbuilding and an end goal to look forward to, which is to unearth Teyvat's secrets and what made the Abyss twin switch up. Ik that's just one big chapter, but it's still an ending!",2,2025-05-09 17:22:40

The few events we get are boring and too easy, and there hasn't been any new 4★ characters in almost a year.

Good Story Music and Animations as well as a brilliant amount of polish with alot of quality of life improvements. However the game is plagued by horrible power creep and it feeds into a really unsatisfying End Game experience for people who don't spend a heavy amount into this game.,3,2025-05-08 03:48:20

"This game's going in a terrible direction. It's power creep central in Star Rail. as long as you're cool with pulling every character the game still feels fun for the most part, but these devs are the worst at balancing their game. I've never seen such a shameless power creep, it's non-stop and too hard to keep up with every month. I love Star Rail, but it has left an awful taste in my mouth in recent months and doesn't hit like it used to at all. It feels like all they know is power-creeping.",2,2025-05-08 02:39:03
"Extreme level of powercreep. Not worth it if you value your connection towards certain characters and their backstory as they're most likely to become unusable in less than a year. Story is okay-ish but storytelling is garbage. Hours and hours of yapping with very little cutscene. If you value your time, money and effort, stay as far away from this game as possible. Edit after devs response: sent many feedbacks over the months, specially since Acheron debut. Nothing improved. So yeah, no...",1,2025-05-08 02:28:10
I was a supporter of Mihoyo in the past but got fed up with it (played the Honkai Impact 3 even b4 the first edition swimsuit skin for 3 B rank character so u can imagine). The power crept existed long before HSR even existed dating way back HI3. They address the power crept by making new gacha weapons for the character instead of changing the mechanic or introducing buff that is locked behind story. This game is good and will last but if like an abusive relationship be my guest.,1,2025-05-08 00:13:52
the start of the gameplay was excellent but as you progress more into the endgame contents you'll find it extremely hard to fit into the current meta as its always changing. With this absurd power creeps the game is becoming more difficult and difficult to the point it's near impossible to beat the end game contents without paying anything. Another thing is how its becoming unbearable for some devices especially low end cellphone's to keep up with the cut scenes due to how high the graphics are,1,2025-05-07 23:54:23

Love this game but if they fix the moc like the hp inflation is too much and you can clear easily only with the meta characters.If it is fixed will give a 5 star Please listen to the community hsr is a good game so giving it a 5 star cause in version 3.3 the hp is reduced and overall gameplay is fixed,5,2025-05-07 23:04:27
"Been a player for a long time, and it's really frustrating when you want a specific character, but there's a pity system where, if it's a hype character, you either spend a lot to get it or save enough to ""maybe"" get it.

Although it probably isn't f2p friendly anymore because I can't clear all end game content, and META is literally get the rate up character and you don't need strategy.

Use to love this game but the devs have made a massive powercreep issue and you cant keep up with the meta or complete end game content without spending. The story has gone massively down hill since penacony and is just getting more more dull and with lots of needless talking and missing half the voice actors when a new release patch comes out with no option to replay them.

"Honkai:Star Rail is a really engaging turn-based RPG with many good qualities: it has an easy to learn and simple battle system, interesting characters, unique puzzles and deep lore. The story concepts are also good but can fall at times when it's confusing, long or doesn't connect with other subplots well.

Don't forget about the global buff, it forces you to pull for a character you may not even like.

The Amphoreus story quests are a slog to go through. Most of it is just stalling for time and progress is just too slow. The quests really don't need to be 8 hours long. Not to mention how boring the presentation is. The characters standing in the same position and the camera angle staying in a stationary position. For a game that's turn based and barely open world I would expect more from it. I think your quests also focus too much on the character you're trying to promote each patch.,1,2025-05-07 05:41:07

"As I've rated other games 5* before, this game is going to be 11*. Best dialogue lines I've ever seen that I actually laughed playing a game, engaging turn based combat since you can jump between turns with your ult, epic boss fights paired with epic music (finish Jarillo VI and get it), multiple ways to grind/play daily etc. Absolute blast. F2P friendly too. Edit: Game died. Content pacing bad + Powercrept x10",1,2025-05-05 19:15:46
"the game is enjoyable in every way. the story is extraordinary, the characters have great design and story, and the gameplay is perfect for casual gaming. i do get about the powercreep issue but it doesn't concern me considering the game is always rewarding and i just enjoy pulling characters that i like. i do suggest that honkai star rail should try getting in to nintendo so that the game can get more famous and can be played anywhere since some phones cant run honkai right now.",5,2025-05-05 19:07:35

"Honestly, really fun game tbh. Started it 4 months ago and I mean yeah, getting jades and enjoying the story is nice in my case here :) The endgame content are definitely a challenge im working on currently but hopefully soon I can clear those! :) Also definitely a hot take but global passives aren't that bad lol. like ive seen devs do worse honestly lol, and it's not like the passives are too too needed lol. You can play without em too yknow lol But I mean yeah, fun game! :)",5,2025-05-05 18:11:22

The main story is complete and really good if we take the time to read, and the characters design are chef kiss. ld only say that its hard keeping up with new characters beacause of how much 5star got release since 2.5 (i belive?). There's a lot of end game content other than quest and its very challenging for players like me who are f2p. But overall, i love this game a lot.",5,2025-05-05 06:56:05

Sure, there's power creep, but that's to be expected in a gacha?? This game deserves way better than a 2 star. People don't realize how spoiled we are in HSR until they try Japanese gacha games with no pity, little rewards, and still have power creep. Smh.",5,2025-05-05 05:52:32

"Castorice's story was a fitting farewell in many ways, as I move on from this game. It's just no longer fun. The powercreep, the aggressive monetization, the stagnant gameplay and lazy difficulty through HP inflation, the ever dropping quality of the main quest filled with dull, mind-numbing rambling repetitive dialogue. It's devolved over time into a soulless corporate cash-grab. They're simply prioritising engagement and mtx, and don't care about the quality of experience.",1,2025-05-05 01:29:16
I LOVE IT🥰🥰 although it's hard to get a 5-star but overall I love it💯💯 the characters are very pretty the only problem is that my device lags too much if i put my quality to medium or high but maybe that is a personal problem😅,5,2025-05-05 01:18:47
"Great music & story. While I think it's odd for ppl to criticize a story-driven RPG for having an actual story, I do think that having the option to skip should still exist. For those that don't enjoy the story, that leaves only the combat, which is turned-based and has become rather lackluster due to the endgame battle content being wholly dependent on the newest character available. It's not unexpected for a gacha game, but it still sucks when characters pulled a while back are pushed aside.",3,2025-05-05 01:13:20
"Hoyo, I thought you were making a turn base game, not dialog simulator. Every corner just an un-skipable dialog waiting 4 me. Brother, idgaf about thanatos talking in riddles.

monetization is just absolutely horrendous.,1,2025-05-04 22:21:16
The game itself is good but the problems is the powercreep got a bit too far like old 5 star characters deal 50000 damages new 5 star characters deal 700000 to 1200000 damages when used their ultimate with buff and debuff. And it have a hard time to beat game. But the story is good just a bit long. I hope we have more cutscenes. But I still enjoy it I just hope they improve the game better.,3,2025-05-04 21:31:11

"The game sadly is very hard to keep up with. The simplicity of the game was what differentiated it from other games, but now the game is morphing more and more into pull the latest character and finish endgame. Characters that you like have very little longevity which really demotivates you and makes one apathetic towards characters. In terms of narrative, the game has a rich lore and is very well-executed.

always played this game everyday and got very addicted to it.This was my favourite since it didn't need that much exploration. however i have failed to catch up because of the release of many 5 star characters and the pressure to keep pulling chracters.It takes so much time to build characters and the powercreep is just insane.It's like everytime a 5 star character is released the other old 5 star chacters are not relevant anymore.,1,2025-05-03 23:23:15

I've played about 400 hours of hsr on my PlayStation with about a 7 month break in between, it's a fun game with a lot of content. Yes the story can drag on at times and power creep exists but power creep is in every gotcha and tbh the bulk of the content especially the parts of the game a casual player is going to be playing is fully clearable with free units.

"I used to love everything about this game, but now it's reached a point where you need specific characters just to clear the endgame content. The story went from a solid 9 to a 4 at best, overwhelming amounts of unnecessary information that shouldn't be in the game like common it's a gacha game at the end of the day",2,2025-05-02 21:38:29

this game is actually very good. i played this game since 5 months and I really enjoyed the characters and gacha is less frustrating atleast better than genshin. lore is very good and world building is solid. if I rate the lore it would be 8/10 but yes you can still improve by not adding excessive dialogues or maybe in future global passive will unbalance the combat,5,2025-05-02 20:30:01
No need to pull any character as they will be forgotten and powercrept by new enemy and bosses and new characters alike.Best way to play this game is to delete it.,1,2025-05-02 20:16:21

This new patch and update is amazing. The only problem I had with this game is the lack of resin even purchasing the pass is not enough for me. The sub-quest and events should give more resin for players to level up their characters. Could at least add a specific day for materials drops increase for farming.,4,2025-05-02 17:37:33
This game has so many issues (3.2): 1. story is boring and long . 90 % of it's just moving from one place to another with long and uninteresting dialogue. 2. story has minimal animation in cutscene and non cutscene 3. game is hp inflation and DPS check meaning no strategy at all . Also strategy is not rewarded. 4 . new unit are better and old units are unusable in moc . 5. moc 3.1 was unbeatable even with 7 premium character with 2 limited lightcone . (with proper build ) 6.globalpasive,1,2025-05-02 17:01:13

"hoyoverse has genuinely fallen off. HSR used to be the better entry, but now the devs have made it so clear that they're not interested in making a player friendly game. HP inflation is insane, units are power crept within 2 patches, and older units have become completely obsolete. and don't get me started on the writing in the latest patches. convoluted for no reason, where decent ideas are not executed in compelling ways. they don't care about F2P. they don't care about you.",1,2025-05-02 15:41:47
"I enjoy this game. While it has been on a bit of a downward spiral, I am holding out hope that it learns from the player feedback and puts more effort into the story and gameplay instead of dialogue. I also hope they work on powercreep and the global passive, making sure that it doesn't entirely wipe out the effectiveness of older characters. I've had some great times on this game, so I'm holding out until I can no longer.",4,2025-05-02 14:16:39
"devs DON'T LISTEN. Powercreep is an ongoing issue with no hope of being fixed. The last 4 star unit (f2p friendly unit) was released an YEAR ago, while 5 stars are added bi monthly. Every new 5 star renders the last irrelevent. Pity because aside from overwhelming corporate greed, game is genuinely charming.",1,2025-05-02 14:12:18

The story is immaculate and the recent planet had plenty of, as usual, plot twists and in depth characters. The character designs, writing, and animations is utterly beautiful and as someone who never enjoyed turn based combat before, it has captivated me and I love building my characters to their absolute max.

"The storyline of this game is very good and the characters provided are also very interesting in terms of design and abilities. Even though the players are F2P, lots of prizes are given every time there is a new patch or from events. Indeed, even though many enemies are very difficult to defeat, if you have a good strategy there will be no difficulty in defeating the enemy. Hopefully the stories to come will be better..

"Personally, I've loved this game from the start. Blade was my main and he was my favorite, but considering how the powercreeping goes, I'm forced to use newer characters who are stronger; abandoning those who I truly loved as characters. It's quite sad to see my favorites getting thrown under the rug because of how brutal the meta works. I decided to quit because of that.",1,2025-05-02 09:43:28

"I used to absolutely adore the game and have it rated 5☆. However, the powercreep is absolutely insane.

"Worst game when it comes to powercreep. None of the updates are balanced so when it comes to endgame content such as simulated universe, you can't just use your favorite characters. With how much of an unbalanced mess this game is, you NEED to pull the latest 5 star character. Which 90% of the time now is just Big Titted Waifu Woman #19286429.

The current major story update has been a mixed bag and the events have sucked lately. The devs don't like to release 4* characters anymore so get ready to shill for the limited 5* characters.

Edited review : This game is going in such a horrible direction with powercreep. New events are so uninspired. The characters now have a forced auto-battle inserted into their kits that you can't even control them and who knows what they might implement next. They treat male characters as beta for female characters. Males are harder to play and with issues while female characters are sm easier to play (maybe coz they think goon audience isn't smart enough to play them lol),3,2025-05-01 21:28:06

"Used to like the game despite how easy it is. But the way they keep releasing less and less content, going against what the playerbase wants (shown with the poor rating of 2.6 currently). Plus this patch doesn't like an aniversary (3.2). An aniversary should be the time to have more different gameplay, to be able to play the game more. Instead they give more stuff but no gamemode to use it on. It's a free game, sure, but I base that on what the game used to provide VS what it provides now.",1,2025-05-01 13:32:20

The game is constantly putting out stronger characters and stronger mechanics that players can't really catch up without spending money or spending a lot of time on the game. The fun gameplay is ruined by the constantly changing meta and favorite characters and severely underpowered against the current challenges.

It started out as a fun and awesome game but now ever since Amphoreus released it went downhill fast with character kit choices and the fact that their have only been 5 stars released since release that are too OP to the point where they are needed for an account which isn't f2p friendly and I literally couldn't beat a boss in amphoreus with my own characters that I had where I needed to get The Herta to actually beat it on the regular mode in the story not the casual mode. I hope it gets better,1,2025-05-01 10:42:12
"as someone who's been playing since release, I'm surprised I'm not burned out yet unlike genshin who I quit after 3.4 update. people have been complaining about powercrept, and the hp inflation as well but all in all I don't care, im fine with not full clearing each endgame mode (though I cleared the recents ones due to having castorice and fugue now, I don't mind that there's not much to do either as I'm busy. I play mostly cause I enjoy strategy and lore and that's enough for me",5,2025-05-01 09:57:57

"Updating review for all the controversy going on. The genshin players review bombing this game is absolutely crazy. The global passive doesnt help anyone but new players so this ""global passive"" power creep really isn't thay big of a deal if they keep it like this. I do agree the story does have ALOT of dialogue that does need to be cut down recently but they are working on that. The only real problem is hp inflation, but even that is not a drop a star worthy update.",5,2025-05-01 08:48:06

disappointed in the direction of this game... as a day 1 player I'm tired of the HP inflation and the overwhelming push for the new characters that it starts making older characters feel obsolete.,3,2025-04-30 15:06:05
"It would be 5 stars if it was made by another company, I can't rate any turned based game poorly.",4,2025-04-30 14:14:40
"People are writing bad reviews for half-assed reasons. The game is actually good. So many baddies and actually fun gameplay. Generous with rewards and such. I may be a little biased cause I love my turn based games, but genuinely, this game is amazing.",5,2025-04-30 14:05:29
It doesn't matter what the feedbacks are. They never listen anyway.,1,2025-04-30 13:57:23
"Please stop the insane powercreep. Almost every new character powercreeps basically everyone except the recent other characters. Especially the supports, you can't just make a support that does a similiar thing as an older support but way better then add other op mechanics on them.",4,2025-04-30 13:50:22

"Decent exploration, Good turn based combat , I like every event y'all working/making even though it's too many but it's totally ok and it's natural to have in the game but one thing is issue was the story, devs stop cutting some dialogues but instead make skip button with a summary in story quest and remove black scene right now!!! It's annoying. Also if old units is gonna get buffs make sure to do so properly, do not mess up please and not being another genshin flop I'm begging y'all hsr team",2,2025-04-30 10:51:33

worst. anniversary. event. ever.,1,2025-04-30 04:39:18
this is a very great game however it is increasingly annoying you can't skip the story making game play extremely slow and you barely play you get next to nothing to level up your characters making every battle extremely long drawn out and extra tedious or just ridiculously extra difficult even when just starting out takes away from the fun of enjoying the actual game shouldn't take away Auto Battle function with a ridiculously long boss battles especially since you can't level up well.,1,2025-04-30 03:45:52
Such a typical gacha game with very characteristic power creep and AI generated story,5,2025-04-30 03:17:37
great game,5,2025-04-30 02:56:57
"You can tell there is passion here for character design, but there is another element that is driving how things are implemented for profit. There is too much bloat in terms of what you need to grind.",2,2025-04-30 02:55:31
no controller support?,2,2025-04-30 01:46:48
"I started playing last March so I've been here for a bit. Free Dr. Ratio was the reason I started. The Good: I actually really like the story direction of Amphoreus, and how it feels like a heroes epic, and is character-focused. Could trim the text. I like the gameplay, and overall, I like the designs. The Bad: Why the negative review then? Powercreep and The Global Passive. New characters blow old ones, even from just months ago, out of the water. Global Passive is a terrible precedent.",2,2025-04-29 23:57:35
"Too many existing issues in the game. Story feels like a chore to do, powercreep making former fan favourite characters feel inadequate, a lack of 4 star alternatives for both lightcone and characters,missing voicelines, poor event quality just to name a few. Hoyo. Pls love your game and its community. This has basically become a trend among your games. I'm avoiding playing your other games just because of the downward trajectory all your games have followed.",4,2025-04-29 23:53:11
"My biggest problem with this game now is honestly the crashing. I can't ever remember the game crashing before Penacony (and even then, it was only really happened with the final boss), but now it's so bad that it happens across various combat game modes. It seems like they've placed so much focus on PC and console that they stopped optimizing for less expensive / older mobile devices.",2,2025-04-29 23:50:49
The game is still amazing and breathtaking. Making yourself stronger by grinding is apart of rpg games especially gacha rpg games power creep is to be or at least should be expected and the supposed too much talking isn't a problem like people say there can't be constant action the length of the game isn't a problem either for me at least that is because i don't mind since non mobile game used to be a lot longer back than anyway hoyoverse is still doing a great job sorry about the rant. 🙏,5,2025-04-29 23:47:29
I don't know what my opinion is about the game. but I think the devs deserve love for putting work into the game's mechanics/characters. <3,5,2025-04-29 23:19:45
this game never fails to make me have fun,5,2025-04-29 23:01:44
The story is damn boring and no skip.,1,2025-04-29 23:01:21
No skip button. How would I watch a 10 hour story. please stop the power creep and buff older units please and don't make p2w content be f2p,3,2025-04-29 22:43:12
I hate this game so much due to the constant power creep and the constant drama along with the storyline getting dull but I keep freaking returning bc of stupid boothill dang it why does that cowboy have to be so likeable,1,2025-04-29 22:37:49
Global passive = lowest rating.,1,2025-04-29 22:20:25
Getting back into the game only to be reminded how much I abhor the endgame now. Every character I have is now obsolete it's insane. HP inflation by over 1mil in a span of a patch. Amazing.,1,2025-04-29 22:02:20
"love the characters and each new planet is super fun to explore, current storyline is great, but the power creep can feel like a bit much especially for players who aren't consistently spending to get newer characters. new content can still be beaten with old characters but takes much more investment and time",4,2025-04-29 21:42:34
"honestly most of the commenters should touch some grass cus yeah if all you do all day is play gacha games then you won't have ""content"" like come on dude, touch some grass",5,2025-04-29 21:33:04
Better than genshit. Just gacha rate sucks so bad. F2P can survive tho. Story 5/5 Graphics 5/5 Gameplay 10/5 Gacha 2/5,5,2025-04-29 21:10:04
"Since everyone is complaining about powercreep and what not, let me tell you that you can get through at least 90% of all the content in the game with old characters. The only places where you can have some trouble is the last memory of chaos levels. There is hp inflation, yes and the powercreep is real. Is the game inplayable though? no. Can you still enjoy the whole story and every single other game mode that's not memory of chaos? totally yes.",4,2025-04-29 20:35:31

"best character design, best lore, best animation!",5,2025-04-29 20:05:46
"This game is the best of Hoyoverse creations by far. The plot, characters and rewards - everything is just very balanced and nice. It is very comfortable for everyone: you want to play because of the plot? It is deep, very interesting and emotional. You don't care about a plot and just want to play gacha? Whatever, there are a lot of rewards to collect and pull for characters, and characters designs and stories are also very tempting. You want to explore? The map is amazing, too! Recommend!",5,2025-04-29 18:48:57
"I used to hate turn-based games, but Honkai: Star Rail (HSR) is one of the good ones. I love the story and the ideas behind it; you can actually find a lot of lore in the free-roam world. The cutscenes, combined with hype music, are really great! Though, I wish they would add more cutscenes than text in the latest update. Also, power creep is an issue in this game, though I find power creep healthy for a game, but this is too much. They are buffing older characters though!",5,2025-04-29 18:39:01
It's f2p but not free to enjoy,1,2025-04-29 18:28:30
I used to love this game so much but one more thing that you need to add. Please add the function where we can lower our Equilibrium Level so we can fight the enemy easily especially the enemy in Amphoreus. Not all player have good builds. Please fix this. Thank you.,4,2025-04-29 18:14:55
too much dialogue i already ate and take a bath the dialogue scene are still on going game is now more dialogue then cutscenes and action,1,2025-04-29 18:01:18
"Was Dolphin player 2 years and then I left the game at March. 1) Older units performs below average so can't play with your favourite units forever as they get power crept by new characters. 2) The more higher damage ceiling they introduce, the more Hp inflation of enemies comes with each and every patches. 3) Story lore is good but they do follow methodical story writting so it becomes out of the place sometimes. 4) Story Presentation is very bad with long dialogue with no screen scene change.",1,2025-04-29 17:52:24

"For all the ""Castorice's Global Passive will kill the game"" players, Sorry but that's one of the many reasons why *We* pulled her. also, This game is good based on Aesthetics. the gameplay is like Persona but with the ultimate and two main attacks(or one since some characters have their skills as heal or debuff as well as excluding the ult since you either need to use the two/one main attack to fill up the gauge or you need to fulfill a certain requirement for it). I love this game(personally)",5,2025-04-29 16:59:35
perfect,5,2025-04-29 16:31:05
"Don't listen to the losers and complainers who are pressed about a little global passive and powercreeping. You can still play the game perfectly fine. Those people NEED to complain about something constantly. It's dopamine for them. This is a free game, they don't owe you anything. Also, this is a TURN BASED RPG. The game IS the story. If you can't handle it, this game isn't for you, and don't play. Sick of people complaining about that too.",5,2025-04-29 16:17:50

The worst case of power creeping that I've ever seen. Unit gets powercreeped in 2 to 3 patches. Crazy. No point in actually pulling a unit when they become irrelevant very quickly.

Don't get me started on the lack of a skip button on a 3+ hour story quest, which doesn't do any better.

The game drowns in a soulless daily grind, demanding endless hours farming RNG-laden Relics and scarce resources, while egregious power creep ruthlessly invalidates older characters, forcing players into a vicious cycle of spending to stay relevant.

I'm just doing this hsr could have a higher review but this game is good despite it retelling the story of the hi3 elysian realm in its own way it's really nice the character designs are awesome and with any hoyo game .. sorta tame community but shipping community is not a way to go ( y'all gotta respect people's decisions sometimes ) the gameplay can get boring but is very fun when your a person who had just started playing ! as usual building characters are so much of a pain :(,5,2025-04-28 08:55:52

"Honestly as a 1.0 player, this game just went downhill update after update. One patch an overpowered character gets released then another patch that character is useless.

Grinding for days just to get a decent set with the right stats feels like a massive waste of time. And don't even get me STARTED on the variable dice in. It adds an unnecessary layer of RNG on top of an already RNG-heavy system.

When I first joined in 2.3 this game was genuinely fun. until I reached endgame content where all u do is do dailies after u finish the main story. Powercreep has gotten insanely terrible where my FART team (All S1 with Aventurine and Robin E1) where I spent so much time and dedication investing for this team is struggling in the amphoreus content. Story is getting more and more yapping without a skip button is awful. Will change rating and rewrite the review once the game improves,1,2025-04-27 08:32:45
"This game could have been so great, but the developers (or board of directors, most likely) have decided they would rather innovate to new levels of greed, rather than f2p friendly gameplay. Also, the writer they tout as ""so good"" actually puts out C tier yap fests they call a 'story'.",1,2025-04-27 08:23:57
"used to spend hundreds of hours on this game and even do my dailies and weeklies like clockwork. latest world feels way too padded with minigames, puzzles and lots of unskippable dialogue. this was my breaking point sadly. if only there was a skip button for all the dialogue (especially the lengthy convos). gameplay no longer is fighting monsters to progress, you now do tedious puzzles and run a marathon just to get to the next part of the plot. i lost all interest to save jades for fate collab",2,2025-04-27 07:50:17
"the reason I'm giving it 1 is Because when I was on the core flame submitting thing where you have to tap and hold I probably held the button for 5 straight minutes and was stuck on that part and couldn't get out of it , maybe if you fix it I'll raise the rating",1,2025-04-27 06:49:37

"Making new character releases absurdly better than the old ones ruined the game balance and the state of combat is in absolute shambles now, too much powercreep ruined the game. The writing for story has also gotten way worse, as it takes too much time and has massive dialogue bloat to deliver a story that quite frankly should be taking half of the time than it currently does. Also, there's no evolution when it comes to the game state, it's the same game as it was during launch but worse.",1,2025-04-25 20:28:26

I don't like the game introduced global passive because they might go this way and release more making you pull characters for just their passives. And of course can't forget about characters being powercreept making your favorite character barely playable in end game,2,2025-04-25 20:08:16

"Doesn't take much time or effort to do dailies with auto-battle feature. HSR is also INCREDIBLY generous, even moreso than Honkai Impact 3rd. I don't feel the need to splurge, and buy only the month pass; it helps that it's easy to commit to dailies thanks to the aforementioned feature. I go for some months not actually properly playing the game, and when I do come back, I don't feel like I missed out on anything due to some event stories being playable after the fact.

Characters with global buffs, like Castorice, are making a significant impact on the game, and I feel that future patches will continue to introduce such characters, affecting endgame content.

with the whole strike going on which in my opinion was a losing battle to begin with and more characters becoming absolutely and it also powercrept i just fell off from the game and now with the introduction with global passives I now know im mostly not going back any time soon until something is done about it i understand a game needs to be kept up to date with new content but this is practically just an attempt to cash grab with still an opportunity to lose the 50/50...

However the powercreep of the gacha is so extreme now that characters can fall off a cliff in power, with even the main story has insane jumps in difficulty, and they've added a global passive to a character meaning no matter your team, its optimal to own them. save your time, and especially your money, and play something else.",2,2025-04-24 09:06:10

The introduction of global passives power creeps every character, and now if you want to reach endgame and complete it, you basically NEED to warp/pull for a character. Which is pretty bad, and theres not many updates any more, in my opinion. Which makes the game a lot more boring. I love Castorice, the new character who has global passive.

"Compliments stop at having nice animations and character designs. This isn't even a turn based game. It's just a simulation. There are no mechanics to play by, just the characters you have, you have done zero research on what a turn based game should be. Lackluster events, the minigames are fine but there is nothing to do with the actual game. Most of the time there aren't many either. The story dialogue isn't appealing in the slightest. Black screen dialogues are used to replace animations. Ew",1,2025-04-23 04:00:53

I've had it since 1.2 and supported it so much. you gain support and have the audacity to just milk us for more money when you already got a lot from peoppe LIKING your game. went from getting money from support to getting money from required characters. hp inflation sucks, lightcone dependent characters suck, endgame is way too character dependent as well. and the global passive? can't wait to see what problems you're going to create..💔💔",3,2025-04-23 02:56:15

"Good game really good game coz i love the genre turned base, can play in low end devices, but don't be so greedy for players sake the characters should be balanced and can use in any end game mode, also i hope for more pulls for f2p atleast 150 pulls per patch so that they can catch up to the two 5star release in every patch........ also make the global passive for anniversary characters",5,2025-04-22 21:09:26

"being completely honest, the game is good, I love it very much but having to pull for characters to clear endgame stuffs for more pulls is just bad, MOC, PF, and other endgame stuffs, I mean I'm still clearing it ""barely"" power creep is highly present in the game and the worst of all banners are 50/50 it's all good and all except you need powerful characters to clear endgame stuffs, the moment you lose your 50/50 your cooked, hp inflation, bosses could one shot you, bosses with high based speed",1,2025-04-22 19:02:45

"HP Inflation and Powercreeping are just getting ridiculous by the day. Old characters buff is just way too late and its only some characters who got buffed in 3.4 (characters like DHIL & Topaz are litterally as good as garbage right now), nobody is using them anymore and the devs just act like hero when buffing them. Not much animations in the story and just slapping everything with texts & Images. Used to like this game a lot, but this game are getting worse every patch.

"i love the gameplay but quit for a while because it became so tedious. the story no longer interests me and takes way too long, way too much dialogue. there should at least be a skip button for it. i understand needing to engage players and fund your games and etc by releasing new characters but the power creeping is insane. the new char literally is so blantant with it, having crit and crit dmg built into their traces and passives. the chars are still pretty and top notch battle animations tho",3,2025-04-22 10:27:50

"Still a five star for me even though there is power creep. As far as I can tell the global passive is not as bad as everyone except (Not OP) and to bomb a review for a game you still play and enjoy just keeps new players away that might also enjoy the game like all of us do. 10/10 will still recommend, don't listen to all the children's reviews that just follow the lead of someone else.",5,2025-04-22 08:26:05

This game used to be fun and now everything is going to absolute dogshit. From the bad powercreep and insane HP inflation making older characters feel borderline useless to the god awful relic system and gacha. I wouldn't have a major issue with the gacha if limited characters were thrown into the general pool after their initial banner ends like most other gacha games. The story has also been a yapfest lately and also please buff Luocha and give him story relevance again,1,2025-04-20 21:24:39
"it's still at it's finest even after many updates, I don't know why the people are overreacting, it's just skill issue at this point, I main yanqing and I just honestly don't see any problems at all sure the newer characters can clear the stages easier but isn't it still beneficial to us? that we can grow at our place, because it's not pvp after all.",5,2025-04-20 21:13:01

one of the worst gacha game I have played in my life. 8000 stellar jades and 20 golden tickets and still I couldn't get any useful 5 star character except welt Yang.

edit: 1 star i can't stand anymore the story is just slow yapping visual novel version with no other way to make it faster. I give 2 stars mainly because 80% of the time we just looking at character standing while only moving their mouth and arms during story. I like the gameplay to be honest but when it came to story i lose interest really quick because it was presented in a boring way. It's such a waste man.,1,2025-04-20 18:22:40

"The character designs and gameplay animations are amazing. The events and other contents are fun although I wish the game added more. The story is amazing! I am flabbergasted with the twists. The endgame content is getting difficult though. I'm not sure if inflating the HP makes things fairly difficult in game design. There are a lot of bugs and low quality textures with the NPCs. Hopefully, the game addresses these technical problems. Overall, it's a good game. 4/5.",4,2025-04-20 17:02:37

"What a letdown. The gacha is abhorrent now. They expect you to spend at least 100$ per month to get characters with full power locked behind eidolons and LCs. The RNG is worse than ever and now you have reroll cubes and whatnot that are rare to come by and offer nothing except more disappointment. Story patches are worse than text blocks of light novels with 0 skip option, the endgame keeps getting HP buffed and characters get thrown under the bus after being introduced. Remember Acheron? Yes.",1,2025-04-20 16:38:09

"Following the long and underwhelming story, blatant disregard for the players wishes when it comes to HP inflation in end game, lack of 4 stars, a global passive to throw of game balance more, standards that Hoyo keeps setting lower and lower, the spending events being thrown in your face on the anniversary and overwhelming power creep issues making my favorite and most invested characters absolutely useless.

Still no skip button for dialogue scenes, which is wild considering how long and unskippable some of them are. And those black screen + white text dialogues? Instead of removing them, they just flipped the colors—now it’s a white screen with black text. That’s not an upgrade, that’s just lazy.

Not today though, thats not possible anymore. For an example, just look at any MoC/AS/PF clears on youtube, guarantee each and every single one of them will have a tribbie, robin or sunday in them.",1,2025-04-17 14:15:36
"Okay, this game is absolutely beautiful. I've been playing since v 1.3 and it keeps on getting better and better. The only problem with it is the community- Highly Immature People who don't understand logic, marketing or entrepreneurship and review bomb the game when they don't get thier way. Other than that, this game is definitely worth your time. The characters, the story and OH MAN DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE OST. Absolute Cinema, 10/10.",5,2025-04-17 14:14:45

"Day 1 player here, This was my favorite game but I will be quitting it now after everything that happened: -Story went downhill ever since 2.0 released (Penacony was horrible) -nobody truly dies thanks to plot armor -global passive and limited top up events are a horrible and predatory practice for the game -hp inflation and powercreep is very real, expect your favorite characters to be unusable and forgotten. Was a 5* game but is now a 1* game. Would not recommend for anyone to play this game.",1,2025-04-17 13:13:30
"Really sad to see such a good game die this quick, in comparison to Genshin which became trash way later. I don't know why the games gave up on the game, but what they're doing is a spit to the players' face. Classic Hoyo. Truly disappointed. Global passives and black/white screens with white/black/red text. AND A SPENDING EVENT just beyond desperate. What a joke.",1,2025-04-17 12:17:16
"Honestly its a great game, but i have 3 problems with it 1) It's Horrendous Powercreep 2) Amphorus has very weird story pacing 3) HP Inflation The Fan Service is manageable and honest if you asked me, Its a very good game but it has a lot of issues with it",2,2025-04-17 11:23:32

"""Please give us money, we promise we'll be better"" is what I saw on the 2nd Anniversary. Actual events throughout the patch are always lacking. The story keeps getting unnecessarily longer and dragging. Powercreep Rail is getting worse and worse. This game used to be a fascinating, promising game but now full of greed and overselling BS. Who cares if one person uninstalls the game, right?",1,2025-04-17 09:51:39
"don't hear the controversy, hoyo players are such a big crybaby. it's not that bad this game is still good if you want to see good story, turn based gameplay or grinding, the graphics are also awesome for a mobile game.

They got events that last for 2 or 3 days after the patch released, what about the 38 days? You either wait for the end game contents, or just do dailies.

"I have been playing for a year now, about 400 days, I login everyday and always have explored 100% and finished through every quest and story quest. The story is niche, sometimes I find myself invested in world quests rather than the actual main quests, Amphoreus had a very bad headstart, but it got better with the Kephale lore. Exploration got so much better, it's my favorite part mostly, even though it's extremely short to complete. Game's really good to pass time with in my opinion.",5,2025-04-17 04:54:30
"I don't care about the global passive, this game is pure fire. It has entertaining stories and the characters are all so pretty, yeah maybe they should make some more stuff free but beside that, the tense and mysterious stuff they put in amphoreus for example is crazy. Honkai star rail, don't let your self down",5,2025-04-17 04:33:33
The game is amazing and the combat is really fast paced and action packed for a turn based game. my complaints are that once you get up to level 80 it takes a long time to get the necessary materials to upgrade your character to make them powerful enough for basic combat and the main quests can be tedious because of how long the dialogue and cutscenes can get without a break. I wish they would balance combat and story better. nevertheless the story and characters are engaging and interesting.,4,2025-04-17 03:55:48
Decently fun game but don't bother they're adding global passives. If you don't know all you have to do is pull a character and your account gets a permanent buff so you either have to save every free gem they give or spend that nice big 300. I've played a lot of these games and this is by far the worst mechanic I've ever seen. Other games have had this mechanic and I'm telling you the endgame for them was impossible because the devs have to assume you have all the buffs. TLDR;Don't bother,1,2025-04-17 03:52:03

Great game at first but now it's beyond greedy and stupid. The powercreep is real,1,2025-04-16 14:40:12
The devs powercreep characters even mere patches after they are out. The worst part is that there are literal 1-to-1 powercreeps. Building characters is slow and super RNG heavy. Then they release global passives that are active if you have the character without them even being in the party. The only way to keep up with the rapid stream of new characters is with micro transactions which the devs constantly add new ones of.,1,2025-04-16 14:38:55

"Ok I used to love this game but it fell off HARD. Hoyo is so greedy with this game its crazy, especially with the 2nd anniversary. Additionally, story drags on forever with absolute yap and nonsensical plot with little to no breaks now, causing burnout, and the powercreep is getting worse and worse. We complained about too much black screen with white text, so they decided to flashbang us with a white screen instead 💀 . Getting Castorice bc I like her design then quitting",1,2025-04-15 21:27:38
"Love the art style and lore, but please work on your character power creep. Introducing new characters with new mechanics is fine, but making it exclusive to a single character is NOT fine. It just makes the meta shift constantly, forcing players to constantly pull for new characters just to clear new end game content. Also, HP inflation is getting out of hand right now so PLEASE work on that one too.",1,2025-04-15 21:21:50
Leaving the game now so that I can enjoy the full story of Amphoreus later when it's completed,5,2025-04-15 21:01:06
The game is good but there is only one issue for me and that is powercreep. man like every 2 patch the characters that i work hard to build will just get powercreep making me pull for the newer characters which is very hard because i'm a f2p player I'm hoping you can fix this powercreeping issue so the end game will be more playable.,3,2025-04-15 20:51:26

don't waste your time on this game. Every new character power creeps all the old character and the HP inflation is just way to high to the point where Old character can't even compete with the new characters. the story telling is terrible and the takes to long (8hrs+).,1,2025-04-15 19:57:16
great game! keep up the good work,5,2025-04-15 19:50:44
"Powercreeping is becoming a real headache lately, keeps forcing you to pull latest characters when you don't even want them. Blatant favoritism of some characters is showing, even when it actually doesn't really make sense. Global passive is such a stretch, bad idea to have it introduced, I really hope no more characters get it. Only story and character lore is good what keeps me playing. I really hope they will fix this because it would be such a waste for such a good game if they don't fix it.",1,2025-04-15 19:23:23

"It's very hard to enjoy the game when your fav characters got constantly powercrept. You won't be able to clear the endgames unless you have the shiniest new character, yet they, too, would be irrelevant after their banners ended. You also need their copies and their lightcones for them to work properly. They haven't given f2p options as well bc theres just no new four star characters. There's about 40 five stars and only 23 four stars. HOW IS THE 4* MORE RARE THAN 5*s???",1,2025-04-15 18:15:08

The gacha rates are low, making it frustrating to pull what you want. Even the story feels less engaging over time. It’s still a good-looking game, but the fun and fairness are fading. Changing my rating to 2 stars. 😡🥺",2,2025-04-15 14:01:02

For the game it is that it has very good gameplay and lore when it first release but the main issue that I've com across is that lack of 4 stars in the game and when the new map was released (Amphorea) they didn't release a new 4 star ever since and because if that it makes the game even harder. As for the 5 stars they have a massive issue of powercreep which makes it says unenjoyable when you get a 5 star and you realize it will get powercreep in the next three months or so.,1,2025-04-15 09:30:29
"The game was good and fun. The devs seemed to care about the community. Now, they seem to care about money. Power creep is ridiculous. I'm not a whale or a F2P, and I will say...I'm about done with this game. I don't know how F2P players will keep up with this powercreep.

Moreover, some people think that the game isn't f2p friendly but I really think that's just hot air as I'm also a f2p player but stellar jades are easy to earn with the game content and big rewards that continue to be added.

"Great gaming experience overall, but it has way too little of ""show, don't tell"". A lot of the story could've been told in a way more interesting and concise way as the story of the game is very good. The way they tell the story sometimes can really do a disservice to what they may have wanted to tell. Even as a casual player, I do believe character power creep can be overwhelming.

"This game was once a master piece to me. I loved the story characters and gameplay and I could actually sit through the grind, but as of recently I've been struggling in clearing end game content no matter how well built my characters are, all time went into grinding and upgrading them become meaningless with each update cause of hp inflation and end game content tailored to the newest characters released. So I quit, characters I saved and pulled and grinded for no longer can be used at all.",1,2025-04-14 19:22:37

"This game used to be loved by many due to massive rewards (free limited characters), good lore, and good endgame contents. But starting today, this game is getting more worse than ever. The power creep is too much to the point you need to pull for a latest character including their sig lc's, they can't even release a new 4 star characters and the last time they released is moze from 2.5 and moze isn't good anymore nor can clear an endgame contents.

"The introduction of global passives ALONE deserves one star. This is insane.

The story is nothing but yapfest, power creep is so high that a character usually doesn't even last for an entire version, and the low amount of effort put behind everything except marketing is honestly disheartening.

they changed up the MO of one of the bosses to force the need for Castorice's revive mechanic. Hoolay doesn't normally take one member of your team and force them into a one on one standoff. in that stance they can't be healed or take shields with them even if gepard fires his ult and gives your team members full shields just before hoolay takes them. your unit has to survive the onslaught literally alone and hope they survive. this feels like coercion to pull for a character you don't even want,1,2025-04-14 11:23:43

"As much as I would love to rain applauses on the game, it is now unfortunately a shadow of its former self. HP inflation is now running rampant, turning your beloved older characters irrelevant. Another major complaint I have with the game is its story. Whereas the first arc, Belobog, was so concise, on-point, and impactful with its story and message. Now the story is just crazy info-dumping, exposition, drawn-out cutscenes, and frankly, boring characters. The game is not worth your time.",1,2025-04-14 08:22:02

Used to be fun but consistant predatory game design has reached new levels. I have played this everyday since a few weeks after launch. It had good character designs and the early story quests were very interesting. Since then quality has taken a notable decline culminating in the devs crossing the line with predatory game design with the release of Castorice.

Played off and on since launch and the game just isn't fun or worth my time anymore. The power creep introduced in every patch is crazy. What used to be top tier units now have difficulties clearing anything new and the new enemies are tailor made to be fought with these new limited units. It hurts more when these units are only a 50/50 chance after 80 pulls. And some of the new units also rely on their exclusive weapon which is a 75/25 to get after 80 pulls.

"look, this whole global passive thing is not a good road to go down, hopefully they learned their lesson with these reviews, but like, it's still a great game. absolutely my favorite game I play, gameplay is great, story is amazing, and you get a surprisingly amount of free pulls every single patch. f2p is pretty easy to do and still get the things you want. keep up the good work hoyo, just stay away from any more passives please. or at least, don't EVER make them increase stats like crit!",5,2025-04-12 21:32:13

Lack of Events & Rewards. More predatory practice. An absurd amount of powercreep. Static screen storytelling with lack of facial expressions and animations. all of that despite they're raking so much revenue. and the quality is just going downhill since 2.x. Please stay away from this game. used to be my favorites now it's just a game for milking their players and I've spent quite a lot being low spender over the past 2 years.,1,2025-04-12 20:56:45

MOC is impossible to clear unless you pull the new unit, and it will only hold until 3-4 patch, after that that unit will be trash ,unusable. and then now with global passive they push you to pull the new unit. just greedy developer, will never touch any game from this dev anymore",1,2025-04-12 20:17:17

Pretty much the only thing to do is story, endgame and events, but there are so few events in each patch that you might as well not count it. The story is good... for only the first 7 hrs.

no new decent 4star characters and f2p five stars are not well enough to clear all contents in game and all old characters are useless in game. At this point I can't even enjoy this game.

"I have played since release, and the start of this game was an easy 5 stars up until maybe halfway through penacony. Don't know where all the money is going, but it sure isn't being used to improve the game. Quality has gone down and powerceep is absurd. Barely any quality cutscenes in hours upon hours of bland story. New characters go straight through elements, defeating the rpg mechanic in the first place. Global passives set very bad precedent. Events are just lazy mini games. Very sad.",2,2025-04-12 01:16:46

"played at day 1 and took pauses to play and this is my pure honest review. addressing power creep : due to my low activity I've never worried about meta but recently since 3.1 the MOC 11 and 12 have been way harder to make it short you lose out on about 2-3 pull every 45 days with all endgame modes combined if you don't have the best characters but good ones if you have the ""bad"" ones you'll lose out on 5-6 pull every 45 days maybe brainrot has gotten to me but story feels worse than before.",3,2025-04-11 17:37:36
"Enjoy the game yourself, do not listen those ""competitive"" players. If you are a casual player you would still enjoy the game even if you are F2P It's a bit challenging but it is not impossible. I mean, why would you want to play this game without challenges in the first place? It's a single player game, just enjoy the story and go with the flow.

power creep is getting out of hand. i know there will always be power creep for these games as its f2p. but i think after this update they cross that line towards p2w for end game. gave it a 2 star if you only want to play for the story.,2,2025-04-11 09:09:58

"personally, a 3 star is fair imo because the blatant powercreep is getting wild, and yes, they said old character will be getting a face-lift, but their basicly adding more monetisation becuase now u have questionable global passives wich we can't really judge for now becuase its way 2 early.And personally myself if these global passives get really out of hand then I will stop playing and not to mention the constant HP to enemies suck but people need to chill with the review bombing",3,2025-04-11 08:29:49
"I play casual, so I still enjoy the game mainly due to me winning a lot of 50/50 pulls, and the game just looking really cool in general, but the direction hoyo took with the introduction of castorice revival ability and the hp increase on enemies makes it a little less enjoyable at times and i feel for those players with new accounts.

"1 star is too much in this case. Old characters are completely and fully irrelevant in the end game modes and also in some regular quest battles. New characters are way stronger than old ones and new enemies have way more HP. New basic mobs have higher HP than bosses in the beginnings of the game. Buffing old units wont fix it, I very doubt so. We get also only few free rewards while developers pretend like 30 wishes for anniversary are a lot.

the games decent you can get the currency to get gacha tickets very easily which that i like and it does have a turn based rpg element. still havent got far into the story but adventure ranks are a pain to deal with along with leveling a character after a battle since it doesnt give out decent xp at all. but 4/5 stars i guess.,4,2025-04-11 06:06:10

This game was so good back then but as months passed by the game's power creep kept getting insane. The new Castorice globally passive is crazy too They will keep releasing more characters with global passive in the future which will ruin the entire game even more.

This game desperately needs a dialogue skip option. 3.2 story is ~8 hour long with like 10 min cutscene (gameplay included). Story might be good but the presentation is the worst i've ever seen. The dev team assured us they will improve it in 3.2 but its the same slop (or even worse) than before. The only new thing is the white screen with black texts and black screens with RED texts. Nice. The devs or directors definitely deserves an applause for this. They've outdone themselves.,1,2025-04-11 01:01:35
"I think these new story lines, also a few patches before, they liked to kill the characters, I mean really frequently right now, it makes me lose interest to play because for them it's making the story better, but they don't even know how to do it and act all smart thinking everyone will love it, I don't care about any of the characters global passive or anything, just bad writing making me want to skip the story and just receive the rewards.",1,2025-04-11 00:54:53

"Updated review: I still like the story and the characters are still pretty good, but there's definitely a fundamental difference between 1.0 and 3.2 Gacha feels like a necessity, the last events were bland and boring, the HP inflation and no 4* characters being released since almost more than 9 months just shows how the game has come off their course to be F2P friendly. So to any who do like to experience the story, it pays off, but it definitely has fallen, devs don't listen to players anymore.",3,2025-04-11 00:04:28
so much power creep. it's not worth trying anymore when it only depends on what characters you have. no skill needed just a character check. even the story isn't worth it anymore. it's just characters talking for several hours with nothing interesting. just endless boring dialogue with just a little bit of story at the end.,1,2025-04-11 00:00:55

"So far so good. The game is generous enough to give you enough characters to build 2 decent teams even as f2p. Though some end-game contents like MOC are hard to clear using f2p team. My biggest concern right now is the lack of resources. Maxing chars need a ton of resources. Hope they provide more energy in the future or make the resources easier to get. All in all, it is f2p friendly but it will take a lot longer to build your chars and teams compared to spenders who can refresh energy.",1,2025-04-10 17:54:54

Loved this game in 1.x played it everyday and spent money for the units I really liked (Silverwolf and Jingliu) and then they got power crept 6 feet under 2 patches later. Now I just feel bad trying to use them since I don't want to go to the relic mines for 6 months to get the perfect gear just for them to get even more power crept with some new unit that has a global passive that gives account wide +25% account wide crit rate and crit damage with the end game balanced around it.

Used to enjoy this game since day one. But recently it seems like the game is being sandbagged through lots of (what I consider to be) wrong decisions.

really global passives in a turn based game and on top of that the end game content will revolve around the current new 5 star character and it forces players to either spend on the game or saved up enough jades to get to pity again get to pity not get the character cuz there is still the pity system which sucks and also you have the light comes which also has its own pity system so think about installing this game very carefully cuz the game does not care about you it only cares about money,1,2025-04-10 10:56:14

"3.2 update still garbage. do you think just changing the blackscreen with reuse 2d illustrations will save the storytelling? it's not HELP, it's not HELP. I feel strongly that some effortless team working on this game doesn't have souls anymore. They don't want to improve, they don't want to make good things, or at least balancing the power level in this game? oh the HP inflation is there.

As a longtime player I no longer enjoy the game anymore. The lack of team diversity for endgame content is a big issue. This combined with a very tedious grind for the right substats in equipment make it tough to rec. As a story based game its passable though quality has declined significantly since Belobog (1st world),2,2025-04-10 09:34:23
"Stop trying to make me pull Castorice. I'm never going to do that no matter how many promotions you jam down my throat. Reason #1: her design is bland as hell.

"my experience was great, but now it just feels washed out. I played since version 1.0. The DPS powercreep has gone off the deep end. If you play any characters released during 1.x version, you will have a worser, harder experience, and it's only 3.0. Many characters are filled with abilities that do nothing (arlan), or have essential abilities for a good strategy locked behind multiple copies. Buffers keep one uping each other to the point they all do the same thing, but better every release.",2,2025-04-10 09:02:36

But ever since the global passive was leaked and made it to live, it doesn't even feel nice even after I got Castorice because I didn't want to waste my work. Call me a hypocrite for having Castorice sure, but I still hate the global passive and how predatory it was. I was going to pull for her not for the global passive, but because I liked her.

Yes, I take breaks from time to time and I gotta say that everytime I come back the demand for newer characters gets worse with every newly-released units powercreeping old ones.

Cut scenes and dialog sequences feel like forever and ruin the flow when you're just trying to get to new combat areas or gain access to new materials required to level up new units. A simple skip button made available for all dialog and cut scenes would improve the flow for a player like me who isn't really paying attention to what the story or characters are saying anyway.",1,2025-04-10 00:43:11

"This game doesn't respect their players' time and pretends to listen to any feedback given. Powercreep is rampant, the characters you pulled a few patches ago will be inferior when the newer character comes, the new endgame will always be tailored to the most busted character (a.k.a the new unit) Yet the devs think it'll be okay to put buffs that are active even when the character is not in the team on a LIMITED CHARACTER. There's also a lack of chara expressions and BAD storytelling.",1,2025-04-10 00:32:57

Sadly I see HSR following suit cause it falls for the same old bs Hoyoverse games do... end game content becomes grueling due to HP inflation and old characters don't get buffed so you essentially have to pull for the new ones.

"I've played this game since launch and I have an issue with the castorice passive. It's too overpowered, she has a global buff that revives a downed ally. The problem is that it significantly power creeps the player's account who have castorice. The other problem is that when new players play the game they will not be able to have castorice until rerun and around version 4.3 she will also not be able to keep up with the meta units. so it's not viable to have that passive on castorice.

I don't think my voice will be heard but without any latest released character you can't clear the endgame content and when you gacha the new character they make you lose at the very high pity which is really very taxing for f2p players btw I am one of the f2p players and this game is becoming so problematic that I don't love playing this game anymore like unless you swipe and whale in the game there's no way out and by releasing so many 5 star characters one after other its over for me now,1,2025-04-09 21:59:39

Firstly the story-wise has become a yapfest with all of the filler and unskippable dialogue, could use more poses for the characters instead of just having like 3 emotes, could also use more cutscenes or pictures for better immersion. Secondly powercreep is a big issue, 1.X characters are practically unusable and HP inflation is comparable to inflation irl",1,2025-04-09 19:10:41

Used to be my favourite but thanks to HP inflation. characters which I used to love have become useless. they can't even clear normal mobs properly not to mention bosses. Mihoyo devs have made their plan clear. run a game for 2 years and slowly kill it then launch a new game and rinse and repeat.,1,2025-04-09 18:56:06

"I hope the developers listen to the fans concern in regards to power creep and global passives. Games should evolve but not in a way where pushing for the latest meta isolates a fanbase. Besides characters, we want good story writing and visuals, improvements in QOL features, good character models and fun gameplay. It is a lot and it will take time, but we are willing to wait for improvements. For starters, handle power creep.",3,2025-04-09 18:24:05
"Thank goodness I quit early on, the game is full of predatory practices and powercreep, even for a gacha. It's hoyoverse, the devs don't listen. Don't spend money on this game, it will be for nothing when your character becomes powercrept in a few months. In addition, you'll never get good relics because the RNG is so bad. Go play Reverse 1999, Path to Nowhere or even Arknights instead if you want strategy gachas that are less greedy.",2,2025-04-09 18:20:43

"I honestly don't understand the hate, but I see their points. However, the game itself is amazing and fun if you focus on the lore and events more than the combat experience. As a writer I'm rarely hooked into games with canon lore, but HSR really got me inverse on each story guest! I love reading how well the lines were delivered specially during Amphoreus! They always stun me on each twist and it really humbles me as a writer! I recommend this for lore lovers 100%",5,2025-04-09 18:08:00

"I know that both chara and weapon banners are rng based, but to constantly lose 50/50 for both banners for 3 version updates straight (after constantly going for hard pity) was super painful (honorary mention to grinding for the relic sets).

"global passive is a big concern when it comes to gatcha games. It is basically insentivizing players to pull for a character that has a global passive even if they don't want that Character, because if they don't pull for it then they won't be at the same as those who pull for it, especially now that the end game content like MoC having Hp inflation and you need the latest characters to beat it",1,2025-04-09 18:02:45

ngl was one of my fave games but then the newest released character - Castorice. she was the developers' answer to the insane powercreep of older characters by the new one: just make one that can't be powercreeped at all! ;; the global passive makes it seem like Castorice HAS to be pulled and you know what i'll be happy to do that but at least try to give enough pulls so you can get her! for a no spender this game can be very harsh.,1,2025-04-09 17:55:25
"Sexist game. Preferring female characters over male characters. Castorice's animation is so good but Anaxa is barely good, no effort put. Both are anniversary characters. This game caters to male players more, neglecting players' advice and complaints.",1,2025-04-09 17:53:14

REALLY GREAT GAME FROM HOYOVERSE ONCE AGAIN,5,2025-04-09 17:41:36
"This is a great game (in the past). I like this game, really really like it. This game once had a great story, challenging gameplay, and loveable character. I played (almost) all Hoyo games, this game once to be my most beloved game. Now it has become a chore, money grabber, and lazy storytelling. I really feel betrayed. Already uninstall it. If you wanna try it, just play it till you clear Belobog. It doesn't matter how long nor how much money you spent, your chars are gonna be obsolete. Bye",1,2025-04-09 17:41:26
The story has gotten worse since Belobog. Over time the power creep has become more & more extreme so f2p and low-spending have a harder time beating end game. we now have p2w global passives. 3.0 kinda sucks ngl. forced to pull 2 to 3 copies of a character for them to be enjoyable & there are rumours that an upcoming character will need their lightcone or they'll be mostly useless. Lack of meaningful events/events in general (there's maybe two or three per patch). 50% of cast has no eng VA's.,1,2025-04-09 17:39:09
"the story is AMAZING and i would say i like this game more than genshin edit: I'm so disappointed in this game ngl, powercreep is CRAZY, hp inflation is craaaazy and you can't beat most end game stuff without pulling for the latest character unless you put CRAZYYY investment into a character. genuinely insane how everyone glazes this game over genshin, yes genshin has its flaws, but this game also has aspects where it's so much worse.",1,2025-04-09 17:36:40

great game even if units get power creeped they are mostly still viable and you can clear story with them whereas endgame content requires more effort. f2p friendly,5,2025-04-09 14:56:09

I dont mind playing this game on a low frame rate but please fix the stuttering of the game it makes the game totally unplayable,1,2025-04-09 14:49:59
"I rlly enjoy this game, it's just that they shouldn't overpower newer characters because then the old ones become useless.",5,2025-04-09 14:46:15
"This game was really awesome until they decided to add limited characters to the 50/50 loss pool, I've wanted blade for ages and basically cant get him now :) i have to spend my savings on a character I don't want to either win my 5050(which I just unwantingly did) or loose to a random character with the chance of it being the one I want really low. When you pulled for these limiteds and lost ur 5050 it was fine bc you're at least guaranteed for the next 5 star. now blade will never be guarantee",3,2025-04-09 14:45:07
Powercreep this game is stupid. Rip my money...,5,2025-04-09 14:43:41

"AMAZING game overall, but please add more expressions for characters in stories and also stop using the black screen with text and buff older characters that's all",5,2025-04-09 14:40:00
"I used to love this game, but the power scaling is terrible. Every patch, they power creep the old characters to the point where they aren’t even relevant anymore. And the endgame content is so bad—they just inflate enemy HP with every reset, so you're basically forced to get the newest characters just to clear it. The devs don’t listen to the community, which isn’t surprising—it’s HoYo, after all. They just ignore player feedback.",1,2025-04-09 14:39:44

"Great game play a good amount of rewards. It's a great story great at exciting and interesting. Enjoyable game play a good game if you have nothing to do.

It's such a good game because the animation and how the devs listen to the community and make amazing changes to the game.",5,2025-04-09 14:29:05

stupid Anniv rewards and more predatory tactics,1,2025-04-09 14:28:15
"HSR used to be fun, but now it’s frustrating. Boss HP is absurdly inflated, making fights long and boring. The gacha system is too fast, pushing meta teams that become useless after a patch or two. Older characters are ignored, balance is nonexistent, and it feels like the devs don’t care. They bait players to pull, then dump those units fast. It’s disrespectful to the community. If this keeps up, more players will leave. Devs need to wake up.🤡",1,2025-04-09 14:27:17
"Definitely one of my favorite games, i really enjoy being able to go full afk and let the game run simply for the battle music while im still on my turn. The story and characters feel really well made (well, some characters are better than others) and overall the events and quests are simple enough and enjoyable. Cherry on top are the world puzzles, especially since the Amphoreus update, golden scapegoat and the arrow puzzles are unlike those I've seen in other games.",5,2025-04-09 14:26:13

"I hoped to give this piece of garbage called Honkai Star Rail, a fabulous rating of 0 stars. It is basically designed to squeeze out your money. I have been losing 50/50 consecutively.I used to be f2p but recently been buying it's welkin moon subscription(basically it's monthly subscription) since 4 months ago, and since then they have been making me lose my 50/50.I hope new players don't fall victim to this money grubing game or it's company.

Sad to drop from 5 to 2 Stars. started out so well now 2 years in but despite the massive amounts of money they make everything is slowly getting worse. just so many lazy and sloppy additions and all efforts going into marketing rather than improving the game. time for a break I think and maybe check in a few months if they got the message.,2,2025-04-09 14:05:45

"Edit: Game is going through a rough patch with lots of controversy, story problems and power creep. Still decent though. Pros: Great music, story and characters. The combat isnt too complicated and its very fun building up you characters. Cons: Its a gacha game meaning its monetization is core to the game, but at the same time they don't have to have ads or similar. Game is more fun imo woth a little bit of spending, but it isnt required and the story is great no matter who you play with.",3,2025-04-09 13:20:59

"Crazy powercrep. Old premium characters won't be able to keep up even acheron and there's no 4 star alternative i know why because 4star character some time better option than 5 star. Quests are unnecessarily long and boring it's so static, lacking expressions and cutscenes. after spending hours on unskippable quests, they only reward you with a few single pulls at most. forced to always pull new characters. it's not about global passive or skill issues but character power overall since acheron",2,2025-04-09 13:05:56
"hsr is kinda (imo) 2 parts: story and combat. if you just want no story , mindless combat, you're probably better off playing a different game, but if not, it's pretty good ! currently, I think the story half is v good (imo it's really good tbh) , altho the combat half has been getting a lot more difficult lately. btw, adding onto the story point, there's no skip dialogue button, so if u go into hsr without actually caring abt the story, you're probably in for a bad time :)",5,2025-04-09 13:04:51

"Played every day since version 1.0. This game fell off hard with powercreep and aggressive monetization now especially in version 3.2 (the anniversary patch) with really tacky UI to try and get you to spend money.

In Genshin, the dialogue is so diverse and it's very interesting to watch with different poses and camera angles each time.

I didn't know if I would like the turn based RPG style but I really love it. Very f2p friendly, I have not spent a single dime on this game and yet I have some cracked characters. Main story Gameplay is perfect, it's not so easy that you can blow through it but not hard enough to the point it becomes frustrating, and the amount of endgame content is noice, 100% must play!",5,2025-04-09 11:40:24

"Good story, good humor, good character design and good variety of gameplay. Too many walls of texts and repetitive combat (though auto battle helps). Recently powercreep is getting insane, but it's still a good game overall",4,2025-04-09 11:33:58
"Intense Powercreep and old characters are really hard to get. I used to really love this game because some characters have an engaging story that made players love the characters even more. however, it seems like those characters are no longer a priority to the developer, not saying that new characters are bad, it's just that there's no point in playing and cashing in (this is unnecessary but when you love a character, you tend to invest in it more) when your favorites isn't relevant anymore",1,2025-04-09 11:33:21

"As a Honkai game, HSR follows the tradition of insane powercreep and copious amounts of dialogue loaded with science jargons and stuff you probably don't care enough to dive into.

The game suddenly started glicthing after it was working perfectly fine for 5 days. With an average of 6 hours usage mind you even the cutscences were fine.

"I loved this game from the start. The characters, the lore, the setting, the turn-based combat, pretty much everything. But with the direction that the game is going, I feel like my love for it is starting to fade. The powercreep and the incentive to pull the newest units is just terrible. Old characters are left in a ditch and barely do anything against new endgame unless you invest to the max. That's why I've decided to quit. Unless Hoyo decides to improve in the future, this game is cooked.",1,2025-04-09 11:25:58

Serious and interesting story, rewarding, fun, relaxing. And it runs so good on phone as well. Both PC and mobile version plays perfectly without any issue. Edit : The game meta system is in shambles, HP inflation of enemies is out of control, and the end game is not F2P or low spender friendly anymore.",3,2025-04-09 11:09:45
"Hoyoverse just released a very gay, very white, and most redundantly, a very powerful trailblazer. Castorice has singlehandedly reduced gacha content creators to tears, evaporated friendships, and repelled the invasion of tourists to the anime mobile gaming genre. I am astonished that Homoverse was able to create a trailblazer that could attempt to approach the omni-potent Silverwolf in terms of setting a new precedent.

"I love this game. everyone saying that the story became a wall of text or just plain boring is wrong. sure, the meta is horrible and how they're making endgame content harder, but to be honest that's the only bad part of Star rail. the breathtaking surroundings, characters and back stories and of course, the new amphoreus storyline and even the storylines before it, like Penacony and Belobog, were so good. I believe that it's inevitable for this to happen.",4,2025-04-09 10:56:56

To all those people saying that the game is forcing us to spend money: you're wrong.

"in just 2 years Hoyo has taken what could've been a revolutionary turn-based RPG game and made it elitist, pay to play and sucked all the positive interaction out of its own community. I used to love the game, now it's just like any other greedy gambling app out there. Do not let your children download this, don't waste your time on it or let it take away your love of gaming like it has so many others. Trust me when I say 2 stars is generous, and it's only because I respect the artists behind it",2,2025-04-09 09:45:54

3.0 feels like rushed. They're trying so hard to sell the new characters. Even old 5 stars mechanics which makes them special are now powercreeped. And now they're going to add global passives to the new limited 5 stars.✋🤡🤚,1,2025-04-09 09:41:20

"The difference in character treatment has become more and more obvious and the powercreep is insane. Instead of making boss mechanics complicated or interesting, they're simply inflating their hp until all old dpses are meaningless. With the addition of the anniversary character, it's obvious what audience they're catering to and that they don't care about anything else. Don't bother starting now.",1,2025-04-09 09:24:06

"What happened to my favorite gacha game? You're not going to have a good time as a casual if you're missing specific limited characters because of the bloated HP values and how terrible most of the old characters are compared to the new ones, limited or not. The story is also less engaging now, the quality dipped around half way through Penacony and now, while it isn't terrible, it is too dry and too frequent to keep me interested. The game is playable, but it isn't worth the time anymore.",3,2025-04-09 09:23:11
"let's just say this game is great, the stories, the characters, the graphics are top notch.

The story is dull and boring every version and it seems to keep getting worse and becoming unbearable. the worst part is that every version now seems to introduce more limited time characters and that these characters need the next limited character to buff up with no other substitute and it only keeps getting worse. the endgame content has reached a point where it requires more than limited time characters or their signature's and require all of them to be a limited characters to clear anything,1,2025-04-09 08:52:56

Whatever happened to fun and engaging events? Or companion stories? And don't get me started on the disgusting powercreep scheme. It looks like it's money first.",1,2025-04-09 08:51:31

Devs have shown they just want money and they don't care about the consumer and how they feel, and will take no time to shill all content towards the new units all the while making sure old units are left powercrept to death, it's so bad they're even adding a 5 star shop and changing the 50/50",1,2025-04-09 08:38:23

"Updating my original review. This game no longer holds the same value as I gave it one year ago. HSR used to be a great game, but ever since Acheron's release, I've seen a major decline with it. The game has essentially become ""have meta or lose,"" and you need to pull certain characters and eventually let go of them to even have a chance with endgame. F2p friendly, BUT nowhere near as friendly as it was before. Simply put, unless some changes are made, it's only gonna get worse.",3,2025-04-09 08:37:36
y'all ignore the comments saying the game is money hungry like they are very generous with rewards AND characters don't just stop working they still work they just take a bit more time than usual to beat bosses that's it besides I've been playing this game for more than a year I've never spent a single coin on it I'm still loving it,5,2025-04-09 08:36:59

All i can say is for PvE games and free, there's always pros and cons about the game, but for what i get is the game is doing good with their content, end game content is supposed to be challenging, the gimmick on all bosses is fine, and i think hp inflation thing is just there to encourage you to play more and farm more to do some damage. If you f2p, then play the game right!",5,2025-04-09 07:21:46

The dialogue almost never (other than when it interests me) catches my attention. There's nothing really interesting about it. I think what would make it more interesting (than changing the dialogue) is having animated emotions during speech, having it foreshadowed other things.

At this point it's predatory to PUSH players to constantly roll for the new characters because they are just ""year 1 character but better.""

I can't use so many of the characters that I pulled before because they can't keep up with the artificial hp inflation the devs keep putting in the end game modes.

"I've been playing since launch and loved the game so much. But now f2p are suffering, the amount of stellar jades I farmed only to lose every 50/50. Now I have only 3 limited characters. The character design for the Loufu characters are boring and repetitive. There is no chance for f2p to breathe when you keep releasing so many characters every patch. Materials farming are so hard that you have to wait for so long until the 6th round finish and not so much rewards. But love it nonetheless",3,2025-04-09 04:06:17

Used to love this game and i took a break from this game for sometime and came back just to see all the character i have is just powercrept so bad as to not even doing damage to bosses let alone mini bosses and so many contents in the game is unplayable because of this. It's becoming like you need to have the newest characters to be able to enjoy the game and clear contents of the game at this point. Atleast listen to your playerbase opinions and rework the old character.,1,2025-04-09 03:33:48

"the game was fun a year ago when the characters were more balanced, you can make teams by mixing and matching the heroes and overcome the challenges, but now it has become a gambling simulator where if you don't pay 100$+ a month, you better pray that you get the new overpowered hero, because the new bosses and game modes are designed around the new unit. sometimes you need to get multiple of the same unit otherwise you won't get their full power. very dissatisfied with the story as well...",1,2025-04-08 23:44:57

Love it!🥰🥰🥰,5,2025-04-08 23:29:26
The game is becoming harder because of the hp inflation and if you don't get the newest unit you won't complete all the game contents easily. Also the global passive is RIDICULOUS.... As a p2p player I stopped spending on the game because there isn't a point if I need to get every unit however I won't stop playing and will hope the developers notice the game's issues and fix it.,1,2025-04-08 23:27:25

深渊膨胀速度太快，策划嘴脸太烂，很多角色抽了1命差距太大，可以说是两种角色。相比起原神，这985策划是真的废，非常骄傲，出赌博抽奖活动本来就是一手败笔，无关谁对谁错，能引起玩家不满就是坏决策。回头还能再嘲讽玩家愿赌服输，借此来彰显自己的决策英明。新年福利跟新版本福利叠加在一起，未来还要出氪金礼包，就像是我看片的时候会弹出一些游戏广告一样废的机制。充钱到一种程度就可以和平民拉开太大的差距。还有6元礼包，不知道的我还以为在打王者。我辛辛苦苦大保底抽的阮梅和罗刹直接免费送。还有一点，遐蝶竟然有仓库技，我们这些辛苦研究排轴和培养角色的老玩家，竟然要这样输给抽了遐蝶的新玩家。他们只需要考虑角色复活了过后能不能打完，我们老玩家以前死了就是死了，没机会了。我们伟大又骄傲的985策划则在无限试探玩家的底线，不把仓库技删了，就等同于承认自己的决策是英明的，而玩家是无理取闹一样。崩铁已经变了，角色我还想抽，但是运营和数值官方就像我那老年痴呆的爷爷一样眼里只有更多的钱。阿格莱雅的剧情风波也是一场败笔，谁能想到丹恒和主角竟然看着自己被遐蝶靠近，可能会死也不作挣扎。,1,2025-04-08 22:29:55

What this means is your active 4-person team will be buffed by an inactive character outside of that team. This addition was neither desired nor necessary. It solves no problem. All it adds is increased fomo via a buff system that forever affect past and future characters. The door's now open. The precedent is set. Start playing at your own risk.",2,2025-04-08 21:41:09

"the game just became more pay to win with the new update, making bosses have an unjustified high HP forcing players to pull certain characters just to do enough damage to clear the end game. especially now with castorice's universal passive, making your character reject death. In conclusion if you're a free to play player you will definitely struggle in the end game, unless you spend money in this game which I don't recommend, but it still depends on how you play the game.",1,2025-04-08 20:55:33

"there are WAYS you could make this game better designed: 1. keep the difficulty of MOC the same until floor 12, BUT keeps increasing it as you add more level/floor to the MOC (more rewards too). this way the older unit will not get powercrept easily 2. make global passive something more story gated (same concept as you progress to unlock more passive for the SU/DU) 3.

The story is hit or miss, and a big thing it suffers from is often sounding like a philosophy dropout that's trying to flex instead of somebody actually telling a story. The game has high production value and has had cool moments and music, but the decisions made for this game are making it suffer. nah man I'm out if we keep doing this.",1,2025-04-08 19:52:36

"I used to love this game, great gameplay, lovely visual, and a casual gaming approach with the dailies... Gradually it became really repetitive, and the gacha system started feeling very greedy.

"They did not listen by not removing the global passive and the extensive powercreep, you have to either play meta/invest into character dupes to do harder content in this game. It actively punnishes you for not playing the current meta of the game.

"I'd like to being saying this :this game is not new player friendly (the new characters require end game story) or casual friendly (if your characters aren't maxed they're useless). The game is nearly unplayable if you don't spend money. Building up characters that you like is becoming obsolete, end game content is impossible without extremely p2w characters and the reward for beating them ? nothing, it's just for the flex of it. no 4 star characters are being added either.",1,2025-04-08 18:52:14

"Horrible. Simply horrible. Any slightly older limited 5 stars is unusable these days and you'd need at least their Eidolon 2 or even 6 to come close with the recent 5 stars at zero Eidolon. Global Passive is the biggest concern not because of Castorice's specifically but because it'll open the gate to other Global Passives, hell who knows we'll be in a situation where we have to pull a specific character to complete an endgame content because of their Global Passive.

The game is really good there are tons of freebies and events the people complaining about the global passive are incompetent we should welcome new mechanics with open hands as the same people later say that they want new things added to the game its your problem for not following the meta and keep on using characters from starter patches of the game even when hsr themselves are giving out enough jades for you to pull for newer characters quite comfortably its a gacha game,5,2025-04-08 13:18:06

"Global passive ended up in the game, greedy company, makes a ton of money, but doesn't care to actually use it to make the game better. You are forced to pull on the next strongest character to even have a chance at endgame.The endgame is constantly getting harder, and RIGHT when they say they are buffing characters they release a character that not having makes your account statistcay worse in every way.

"Extremely disappointed with Starrail due to its severe power creep. The latest patches have rendered older characters unusable. We got global passives before char buffs so you can see the devs are money hungry. The constant need to pull for new characters to stay competitive is frustrating and makes the game a cash grab. The no of events are very less now. Bare minimum quality patches and the story is aimless, lengthy and boring. Penacony story climax with Sparkle doesn't make any logical sense",1,2025-04-08 11:16:22

Every time a new character releases, it feels like you're forced to pull for them because they're meta and bosses are getting harder and harder to defeat. If you don't pull for new characters, your team is going to die. On top of that, old characters that were meta before are now considered bad.

It's fun and it's challenging, but sometimes the difficulty just becomes too much and it ruins the fun.

"Honkai star rail is a great game and is the only gacha I still consistently play. I can only fault the powercreep with new characters but from a business point of view they need to make money somehow and in my opinion the insane amount of free rewards they give out makes up for it. It has been consistently enjoyable, easy to grind and also simple to come back to if you take a break.

"bunch of ungrateful people in the rating section complaining about the powercreep while im here still with seele and the standard banner character doing fine, they are just lazy to grind and upgrade. we r given free rolls every new character drop but so many people are still a bunch of losers crying about it. here is a fact for you ungrateful people in Rating section, you're not forced to get every new character LOL, unless you admit you're just addicted to gacha and can't control yourself",4,2025-04-08 01:41:08
"it's a pretty cool game, idk why many people hates it because of the ""Global Passive"" like, if you don't like it don't even bother to think about it and move on. it's not THAT hard right? this is basically a turn-based adventure game. what do you expect from this? criticizing the game and giving feedback is alright but, there's a limit to it.",5,2025-04-08 01:40:07

"HSR dibilang kasual, tapi makin ke sini makin berat. Musuh makin tebal, char makin meta, pemain F2P makin kewalahan. Global passive kayak Castorice rawan bikin imbalance. Beberapa char dimanjain, yang lain kayak dianaktirikan. Meta cepet banget berubah, event makin sepi, story 3.0 juga kurang greget. Game ini arahnya mau ke mana? Kalau terus begini, jangan heran kalau pemain mulai ninggalin satu per satu. Kritik ini karena peduli, bukan untuk benci. Tolong pahami.",3,2025-04-08 00:48:38
"Castorice is so broken and I just can't play the game anymore. I used to play this game everyday for past 2 years. And now I quit. I thought the game will improve but it's not improving one bit.

More yapping and less action what the heck??? 10 hours of playing the story and this is how we get? this will be better if they just make a skip button like wuwa and zzz. I played this game when it was came out and we expected that they have skip button in coming version but it's version 3.0 and still not having a skip button. This game will get the same treatment as genshin did. The new issue about this game is the past characters are being power creep they need to buff them.,1,2025-04-07 21:48:57

It's a game, and yes hp inflation is annoying / this is like predatory test from them. but to be honest, if you don't enjoy the game, just leave and be done. worry about it later if things do get out of hand. if you're deadbeat on rating the game 1 stars, might as well uninstall or don't spend at all, easy.",5,2025-04-07 16:07:42

Global passive is a bad precedent for even more crazy global passives down the line. Also: - Insane powercreep - Lacklustre events - Unfair treatment among characters in terms of promotional content - The difficulty of endgame is unjustifingbly harder (increasing boss's HP by 20% every patch instead of unique gimmicks is not the way) ... and obviously a lot more negative points to turn this game from a favourite to a total let-down.,1,2025-04-07 02:09:53

"powercreep, global passives, hp inflation, predatory rewards, old units basically useless, false promises from hoyoverse... I once believed genshin could never but I realized it's the same company... I'm done with this game and hoyoverse in general. Who knew a $hit company would make $hit games",1,2025-04-06 18:58:48
very casual and nice cool story and that's okay,5,2025-04-06 18:57:59
bad game too much monetisation,1,2025-04-06 18:57:19
"No 4 charas released for a year. Powercreep going crazy. Old 4 stars arent usable. Pity are rather stingy. Upcoming global passive. Multiple banners. Y'all really going HI3 route fr, but atleast my money spent is worth more for there is an actual PvP there unlike HSR. no wonder yall removing the good ol ""tech otakus save the world l"" slogan, self aware enough arent we.",1,2025-04-06 18:56:15
"I personally thought this game was boring first, but when I played it, it has a great storyline, gameplay, character details, character personalities, different types of planets/worlds, and much more. Players are treated great this game for me is overall 10/10. This is just GREAT, if you're scrolling and having a second thought downloading this game, try it, it's very fun to play!",5,2025-04-06 18:48:45
"I love the game, but the powercreeps are getting ridicilous. Forcing players to spend money or spend more time on a game just so they can have a chance at beating some of the more difficult stages of it isn't a good look at all. The story is good, the animations are perfect, the combat is interesting even if it's turn based, but the developers seem to care less and less about the playerbase. It's sad to see what this game is starting to become..",1,2025-04-06 18:48:25
the story is very epic i really like it,5,2025-04-06 18:45:33
"The characters design are great, especially the male characters. But the story could be better since they always info dump every time. Tho the powercreep is too insane, with hp inflation every patch, eventually you feel like you're racing against time with stronger bosses, while the best way to mitigate the issue is to pull for the newest 5 star characters. On the other hand, the 4 star characters are only released once in a blue moon with subpar multipliers.",1,2025-04-06 18:35:46
"Don't listen to all these salty players, the game is great, they're just stuck in the past and can't move on, things obviously won't be the same, this goes for any game out there, change is inevitable, adaptability is all we have left, and it seems these people can't adapt and get good in the game. It's clearly a skill issue but hey it's all love out here in the Astral Express <3",5,2025-04-06 18:27:17
"10/10 Truly enjoy this game. I can play wherever i want. This game really changed my opinion about turn base game, the graphics, animation, design. I like how the story is not too short because i don't have to worry about not having any content left. I really enjoyed the early community back then when HSR first came out, such a lovely player. Even though HSR today's community is a bit... toxic... It feels like it's becoming genshin community... But overall everything is good",5,2025-04-06 18:25:34
full powercreep and story is more boring and lazy each patch,1,2025-04-06 18:11:48
"nerfs existing characters and power creep every update. pay to win now but great characters and story. if you're not interested in pulling many characters and not being worried about being unable to finish content or you have money to spend, its a good game. personally the nerfing of my fav chars & power creep leaves me uninterested in putting effort in after i used to spend hours a day playing. unless a random cool character interests me. last year this would have been a raving 5 star review",1,2025-04-06 18:11:26
"pls remove en dub, those normies who knows nothing about gacha game and ruining this community will finally gone, im guarantee you the score rating also will become better after that",5,2025-04-06 18:10:19

nice game......,5,2025-04-06 18:03:17
"Great worlds for exploring, amazing storyline, beautiful characters with great personalities, however once the game is successful and now in third year, they don't let out good events, companion story and the power creep is derailed so badly that you need all limited 5 start one after one. Pure money grabbing tactics. Try ZZZ, other two hoyo (including this) have gone off the rails!!",1,2025-04-06 18:01:24

global passive and killed anaxa's character to promote their newest waifu castorice. what else to add?,1,2025-04-06 17:43:22
"i don't know if anyone experienced this but the game started to get stuck in the middle of the topaz and numby mission in a cut scene. I couldn't do anything anymore, the arrows were gone. I couldn't jump to the next cut scene, it was just stuck. after closing the game and re-opening it I couldn't start the game anymore just saw a black screen for over 30 min I gave up. currently uninstalling the game and try to re-install it but it's a really annoying thing to happen.",2,2025-04-06 17:40:58
power creep,1,2025-04-06 17:20:46
"Loved this game, though I somewhat don't understand this Castorice drama, like bro, if you got problem with free revive, then just simply don't die, that's all or if you want your characters to die then simply don't heal them after they resurrect, they will die by themselves in their next turns 😑",5,2025-04-06 17:17:21
"Used to be a Great Game in the past but now the game is slowly turning into a treadmill for spending, with little regard for long-term balance or player loyalty. What was once a passion project now feels like a monetization machine disguised as a game. Extremely disappointing direction.",1,2025-04-06 17:12:15
"as an f2p I enjoy the game I mean yeah the power creeping other characters is bad considering how much someone invested on a character that now is useless because of the new one but everything else is good in my opinion the story , the character designs , the gameplay I played other games like genshin, honkai impact and more and out of all these I enjoyed hsr to the end I just hope they buff old characters and just listen to the players",5,2025-04-06 17:11:22
Starting from v3.0 I didn't enjoy the game like I used to be. The gameplay mechanics all went bad to the direction you devs forcing players to spend more to clear end game contents. Lack of new / usable 4-star characters for alternative in team building without relying brand new limited 5-star makes end game contents very hard to clear. Not to mention there's still no info about new 4-star characters from Amphoreus which it's been like a half-year from last 4-star (Moze). Disappointed.,1,2025-04-06 17:08:17
"I just started playing in 2.9, and I gotta say, playing this game at first was really fun, there were so many things to do, but when I got to endgame, it just kinda got repetitive, just log in, do dailies, build characters (I keep running out of trailblaze power, ik i gotta play more alr?) and thats it really, you just gotta wait for the next update to be able to do more things, other than that, the MASSIVE powercreep and the banners, like cmon, Castorice with 3 premium characters?",4,2025-04-06 17:02:20
"the game is very fun, the storyline and the characters are incredibly done. However the endgame content has become very hard to beat without the new character that drops which kills the fun",3,2025-04-06 16:57:44
now it's a bad game so disappointed to hoyo 😒😒😒,1,2025-04-06 16:53:39
"at first i didn't mind at all with the powercreep since I'm spending quite a lot on this game and been playing since day 1 but the moment you have a global passive i decided to stop playing this game anymore, Castorice passive isn't that good but who knows how many characters will have global passive in the future",1,2025-04-06 16:49:58
it's fun game,5,2025-04-06 16:38:38

"Have fun with the game from patch 1.0, love the team building aspect of the game But the direction of the game is getting worse and worse in end game perspective and storytelling wise. I can't recommend the game to new players, cause it's hard to catch up to the other players. Literally takes many months so you can challenge the end game.",2,2025-04-06 16:17:46
"Insane power creep, hp inflation, unnecessary long dialogue, bad writing, overused animation presets, too many limited characters per patch. This game needs to slow down and reassess their strategy",1,2025-04-06 16:12:04
love the game,5,2025-04-06 16:06:21
Out of all the games I played... this one is best... but one thing I don't get is... why do a lot of people review bomb for global passive? should they go to survey in hsr instead of review bomb the play store?,4,2025-04-06 15:58:40
Powercreep and HP inflation is a massive issue. Nikador was an alright boss because at LEAST it was still a mechanics based. While others are too HP inflated,1,2025-04-06 15:58:15

"with the game powercreeping units within a few months of releasing and the stale story presentation, I can't recommend this game to anyone who isn't wealthy.",1,2025-04-06 15:12:52
good game but please put skip story option.,3,2025-04-06 15:01:49
"thought this game was way better than genshin but turns out just another predatory games from hoyoslops, was a 1.0 player but after all of nihility characters become completely obsolete i am absolutely done with this game or any hoyoslops games.",1,2025-04-06 14:47:44
I DONT CARE THE DRAMA. yes i dont care and Im still gonna play this game no matter what.,5,2025-04-06 14:42:48
"super power creep, units less than a year old get power creeped constantly",2,2025-04-06 14:37:41
why the rate went down to 2.9? what the heck???? this game is so sick especially the Amphoreus THAT the developers work hard on it,5,2025-04-06 14:36:23
"The devs do not respect the players with the amount of predatory actions they are taking. To do this during the anniversary is crazy, it should be a big celebration for all the players but it feels like a normal patch with extra pulls and a lot of announcements for the future. Why not do some of those future things now like the character buffs. Give more actually content to do in-game, not 30 second events. It feels like it's pointless to log in all there is to do is dailies.",1,2025-04-06 14:33:02
"I played this game ever since it was released, I once enjoyed it and now with the hp inflation of bosses. it's impossible for us f2p players to clear it without the new and meta characters, fix this hoyo.",1,2025-04-06 14:29:05
"best game in Mobile, people just can't stand the recent update because they will fail 50/50 on future , very salty",5,2025-04-06 14:26:45
"not having fun to play this game anymore. the game is too predatorial, power creep is too fast. really not recommended to spend time and money for this company, never listen to the player feedback. for player who played this game since released, and have couple E6 char including blade, which is being worse than the newest E0 character. if I can give less than 1 rate, I will do. for any player who never touches this game, please find another game.",1,2025-04-06 14:23:32

"GLOBAL PASSIVE, Powercreep insane lol",1,2025-04-06 13:53:12
horrendous game no events no good story no good gameplay just milking their playerbase (cause genshin was a hit) by releasing multiple 5 stars every patch and with soo much powercreep that if you get a character now it will become outdated in 3 months(2 patches) that's how bad this game is doing,1,2025-04-06 13:49:01
"I'm not gonna go back on the great things I said about this game, but the way things are going on right now with Star Rail? It's getting hard to justify to recommend and keep playing this game anymore. There are so many issues regarding endgame, characters, and meta that is so overwhelmingly pay to win gated. I don't wanna keep spending money to this game anymore, but you'll see me in your other titles, peace.",2,2025-04-06 13:48:25
The power creep is a little bit on the nose. Not a fan.,2,2025-04-06 13:47:03
Global Passive is suck.,1,2025-04-06 13:44:59
"Quite a good game. I think it takes way less time than Genshin impact, and its game play is way simpler to understand and play. The stories are well-planned, and the characters r attractive with interesting back stories. Just a pity that u can not play with your friends / you can only use their support characters they put.",4,2025-04-06 13:44:54

Please don't make this game turn to p2w game or I don't want to buy anything from this and your another games.,1,2025-04-06 13:23:16
"Used to love the game, too bad the powercreep problem has been getting worse and worse. Older units we all loved are now completely useless on newer content due to the HP inflation and Mechanics that is always in favor of newer units.",1,2025-04-06 13:16:58

"game is getting worst, story present getting bad",1,2025-04-06 13:10:11
"I really love the game. The only thing that I believe is quite lacking compared to others like Genshin and ZZZ is the amount of events. The events are too short and the few. That's all from me. Overall, I don't think there is anything else worth fixing aside from the lack of events. I really like this game and I give it my full support!",5,2025-04-06 13:01:18

predatory game after you finish quests,1,2025-04-06 12:48:43
nah people forget this is gacha games if you can't follow meta then you won't be able to clear end game content its all about being smart why complaining when you can't follow meta? its your fault you want to enjoy games pulling who you wanted instead following meta like for ex pulling all dps like are you stupid? of course you can't clear it back then i clear it with jy and anything in the second team its hard but do able and as you pull good support youll do it easier thats just how gacha is.,5,2025-04-06 12:32:33
Have been playing since release but not sure what's with the community being toxic on anniversary events spamming 1 star reviews also if you don't like it then please quit it. Also yes pretty much decent game but Devs need to note of power creep on every mocs. The people spamming one star needs to get a life we should be glad that the Devs are generous enough greedy players are the problem here,5,2025-04-06 12:30:51
"Honestly I'm giving this game a 1-star despite it being a ""good quality"" game. First of all, imagine having to pull for newer characters just to clear an endgame mode that when cleared, only gives you a miniscule amount of currency that is so low compared to the amount of currency you spend on the character that you just recently pulled. Also the fact that some QoL are still not here despite it being version 3.X (e.g. Artifact Loadouts, Eidolon Toggle) is quite baffling to us day 1 players. 🥱",1,2025-04-06 12:30:31

absolutely trash,1,2025-04-06 12:12:08
i love this game. it has turn based system and gacha system also gives interesting story plot and awesome character designs. i think other people were overreacting over something happened to this game. it's not a competitive game anyway. play what you want to play.,5,2025-04-06 12:04:29

this is an awesome game I would recommend downloading it I started in September 2024 been playing ever since I have a few requests for the developers when you see this I would want to see a multiplayer function or you can team up with players on free roam or something the other thing I had an idea for this game I wish there was an option to make boss battles easy or hard because I noticed when you are trying to defeat a boss you can't change the difficulty I wish there was an option to change it,5,2025-04-06 11:03:23

"Probably the worst game I've spent my time on because all of my reasons are half the one stars in this app review (powercreep, hp inflation, etc) the developers will add a global passive in which would bomb the game in a bad way, being Free 2 Play would be extremely hard unless you pay for the new characters in which, sometimes is, REQUIRED TO PULL, and even 2.0 characters are struggling to keep up with the ""meta"", I've quit after finishing the 3.1 story, i will come back if the problem is fixed",1,2025-04-06 10:47:08

Even if you're not an endgame grinder, the story quests from 3.0 have been straight up dissapointing, it's like there's no effort going into the story outside of cutscenes.",1,2025-04-06 09:14:48

"Used to be a fun and chill experience, they were generous and listened to feedback but now it looks like it's under a whole different management. Powercreep, HP inflation and boring/lazy story telling. Powercreep is normal and happens to every game, but when you pair it with tailor made end game buffs for the units who are powercreeping along with massive HP inflation to the point that older characters stand no chance whatsoever it becomes a problem.

Nice gatcha game with all the bell and whistles. Pull rates are decent. Pity is there. Character designs are gorgeous. Even the lore seems pretty in depth and good. You'll like it more if you have played honkai impact 3rd before. I would say its worth spending some money to make it more enjoyable and easy (farming is a real grind ) but can be enjoyed enough as f2p also. Power creep is an issue though.,4,2025-04-06 08:02:26

"Didn’t expect to get hooked this fast. Just started a bit late but man, this game’s legit. Story’s solid, characters are super fun, and the visuals go hard. Combat’s clean too — way more engaging than I thought it’d be. Honestly feels way too good for a free game",5,2025-04-05 20:04:57

"HP inflation is up over 50% since acherons release. Global passives are in game now and completely destroys the identity of the game. its no longer a team building game, its a 'pull for every new character and have them on your account or else you cant play any of the new content' game. Also still waiting on the devs to livestream playing through all endgame content on a F2P friendly account. according to them its easy and accessible for everyone. this hasnt been the case for over a year.",1,2025-04-05 19:50:27

"It was one of my favourite games. I played it till 2.4 and uninstalled it but kept in touch with all the news. Sadly when I joined the game again in 3.1 neither of my pre 2.4 units (meta units) works at all. It's really sad that the game that we all loved turned out to be a money hungry game. Looks like the devs don't even care about the game nowadays with all the lazy events (2 events per patch), focusing only on some selected units, bad storytelling and constant power creeping of great units.",1,2025-04-05 19:41:33

here is some issue I found in this game 1. relic farming/upgrade is border line abyssmal 2. doesn't have enough rewards as an f2p 3. it's not fun to play any more because of hp inflation and older characters is not playable even with good/decent relic set. 4. the game become more and more p2w than f2p. and don't get attached to the characters you pull they gonna get powercreep fast (like 3 to 4 patches after their release).,1,2025-04-04 19:43:13

They always get some time to shine, then fall off pretty hard or slowly... not sure how much I enjoy that. The only characters that stay pretty much the same are supports.

"Honestly, the game has been disappointing lately. I've been playing for the last 2 years, and the game has only been getting worse. 5* characters are highly reliant on their Sigs to function normally, and the new path doesn't even have F2P options. Endgame has high emphasis on HP inflation with very little mechanics to worry about. Old characters are dead and buried. The story is overeliant on black screens and exposition. Maps are reused across multiple missions. It was my favorite...",1,2025-04-04 16:59:45

"Game went down into sever powercreep, anti consumerism and predatory business tactics very quickly over the last year. Most characters will be powercreept within a few updates of their release. Yet there are still 2 new 5* every update. While barley any 4* units are being released. And on top of that Castorice will introduce global passives into the game, making the balancing of the game even more miserable for f2ps. Furthermore the game is lacking content and has rather poor storytelling.",1,2025-04-04 16:13:23
"The main stories might be confusing at first, but slowly it becomes a bit understandable. Characters design are ok, gives bonuses better than the other developer game. Overall i enjoy the game.

Oh how the mighty have fallen. This game was something I played very frequently since global launch . But with the recent attitude the Dev's have towards their game it's final nail in the coffin. How much more will u break the game's core mechanics ( especially in turn based game btw) just to sell a powerful character. Powercreep is insane. Now with the upcoming update u don't even need to have the new char in ur team cuz they make ur entire account better just by getting them . Predatory Asf,1,2025-04-04 15:47:48

In the recent version - mid story with ppt slide instead of real animation, 2 events for 40 days that took me 2 hrs to complete. I am not sure what is going on. If you want to make the game predatory to get players to spend, at least invest the budget to make the game engaging with the main quest and events. 100% will not recommend this game.",1,2025-04-04 12:04:34
"The game has fallen off a lot sadly. Insane amount of power creep which causes low spenders or free to play players struggle clearing endgame content, story has become lazy and way too long, and overall effort in making the game fun and interactive has been all gone with these recent patches. These recent updates have simply just not been fun for me. With the announcement of anniversary and the introduction of a character exclusive global passives, it opens the door for more FOMO.",1,2025-04-04 12:02:22
"Powercreep is an issue in most, if not all, gacha games, and this is the worst case so far. It's impossible to clear any main quests using old characters, and HP inflation is out of control. This pushes free-to-play players to spend on new characters just to continue the story, only for those characters to become powercrept after three to four updates. If they choose not to spend, like me, they will have a very hard time progressing through the main quests and will eventually quit.",1,2025-04-04 11:58:45
"insane powercreep hp inflation they doubled down on it by introducing global passive , which is passive ability u get by just having just character on ur account. story telling is awful,no expression and animation just single camera angle and single pose with 10 min dialogue 1/10 would not recommend to anyone",1,2025-04-04 11:58:43

But, being a highly monetized gacha game, it suffers from the many pitfalls that come with gacha territories, which punish the long-term, F2P, and low spending player base.

I'll list all the problems if your new 1) it's not f2p because you need new characters every patch because the powercreeps ever since 2.0 is insane. 2) Instead of doing something interesting they just make enemies increase hp making then damage sponges. 3) Boring cutscenes even for those who like reading why? because most of the dialogues are meant for padding time. 4) Old characters are weak af. Even maxed out characters are weak compared to new characters with minimal efforts.,1,2025-04-04 08:55:24

If i could rate this a zero i would. This game has had a powercreep issue for over a year now and new characters dont even last 3 months till they are powercrept again. The difficulty is skyrocketing and unless you have thousands of dollars. this game is jusy unplayable cuz you will fall behind so badly. i use to love this game but since 2.6 its only been getting worse and aftrr 3.0 we were given a false promise tht theyd fix the game by 3.2 only for them to make it worse.

Not all can pay to clear game content. MOC situation is crazy, and this is coming from someone who pretty much pulled for new banners (I have Mydei and The Herta.)

Other issues have been made by others too",2,2025-04-03 22:44:10

Global passives are the biggest issue and are ruining the game and the power creep is out of control to the point where old characters are useless for newer content and the new content is too skewed to the new units.

It was bad before and with the new mechanic it's worse now. Do not play this game UNLESS you like bloated, visually unappealing storytelling, a basic combat system, underwhelming gameplay mechanics, meaningless game events and characters that get ignored after 2-3 months.",1,2025-04-03 21:05:15

The story is not really bad, but the way they told it is horrible. Lots of scene is just dark screen with paragraphs of words that explain what happen, and it will skip to next scene. 3.0 have like 8 hours of playtime, and from that, almost 6 hours dedicated to reading text on black screen, seriously.",1,2025-04-03 20:55:21

"The 1 star Global Passive reviews are just doomposting review bombs. There is currently no evidence that Global Passives will include stat buffs. The game itself is still very generous with free rewards, a great story, and good gameplay. None of these have changed from 1.0 all the way up to 3.2 currently. The devs have even heard about the powercreep issues and are starting to work on buffing older characters starting in 3.4.",5,2025-04-03 20:37:49
"I have been playing this game since it's release and all I can say is I am disappointed on how this game turned out to be, the lack of proper storytelling and the amount of black screen, also the meta is awful what's the point of letting your players love the game if the character they love just lost it's value? and even forcing them to pull new characters in order to clear new content or even participate in the story. I do hope the movement and changes of the meta will help old characters shine",1,2025-04-03 20:36:50

"i would play more if the game formula isn't just turn battling over and over again not tp mention the lazyness of just increasing HP instead of reaction each weakness or something, also majority of the support is just bland with just buffing the most specific dmg instead of globally, rampant HP sponge end game enemies with the most specific buff of MOC for recent characters instead of globally/neutral/no buff, also incoming global passive will justify the dev to even more scummy practice",1,2025-04-03 15:49:00

"The game started off well but then went downhill, and it shows in the Amphoreus story. There are too many black screens telling us what happens, not enough cinematic moments. There's more quantity than quality during this main story. Don't feel any immersion to the world at all. The powercreep has gone off the charts. This tells me that the devs dont know how to balance their characters or have given up. They've become greedy. It feels like they don't care about the game, just another cash grab.",1,2025-04-03 15:41:03

As of 3.2 they decided to add global passives that will open the door for heavy power-creep since you will need to get characters you don't like because otherwise your account is worse than those that have characters with global passives.

"Seeing it now, spending on the game is hopeless, what was spent is irrelevant when the game has an accelerated power creep system. There's no purpose to start playing later on and new players are expected to compete with the accelerated difficulty, the only way to even play the game now is to spend more than what was necessary to even enjoy. Liking characters is pointless when they are irrelevant in everything, because it's obvious the developers only want specific characters to have spotlight",1,2025-04-02 21:19:48
"With the upcoming anniversary they keep promising things for the future instead of fixing them asap, the HP inflation situation has become too absurd, they're making newer characters more restricted and 4 options don't exist. the buff for older characters is probably gonna be their last chance to redeem themselves or embrace their next level of predatory decision making.",2,2025-04-02 21:17:35

"I am quite disappointed about the state of the game. Newer characters simply outclass older ones with enemies turning into nothing but health shields with millions of health.

Well for starters the game is great and being playing this since the first released. For me the only problem is the that we don't have 4 star character anymore ever since the last update which is sad.

The game has been going downfall ever since they've released Acheron. Powercreep has been going crazy that it's impossible to clear content without pulling for the new characters. HP inflation for end game mode + predatory practices just brings disappointment with the new addition of global passives. Older characters becomes irrelevant each patch and it becomes harder since the in-game rewards isn't even enough to guarantee a character each patch. Don't even bother wasting your time w/ this game,1,2025-04-02 12:15:03

played since launch and stop until they add A GLOBAL PASSIVE BUFF THAT LOCK BEHIND PAYWALL. stupid move greedy devs. i will never play Hoyo game ever again. find other gacha games that is non hoyo. better storrytelling. heck even NIKKE tells a good story then this game. amazing at launch and slowly declining to be a cashgrab game. so deserved 1 star.,1,2025-04-02 02:49:18
people stop complaining just because 1 character has a good global buff. It can only happen once per battle and is the equivalent to bailu in your team. and what do you mean they've made it pay to win I've saved 180 warps in 2 patches that is not a greedy game. and power creep seriously just because newer characters do higher damage easier doesn't mean old characters can't do high damage either plus newer characters require more investment where as old characters are easier to build & still good,5,2025-04-02 02:41:52

loved this game before bit the thing is i joined in for few certain characters i adored but recently the powercreep and stuff like castorices global passive is forcing me to to pull for meta characters which i dont want. I had quitted before due to this issue joined again for a rerun and found out it got even worse. At this it is disrupting a games balance. One characters being insanely strong than the other makes it feel like a 6 star...really dissapointing,1,2025-04-02 02:02:20

"It actually has a good story-telling and gameplay, along with its turn-based. The only problem about this game is the power creep where the old 5* are getting benched or not getting used as much as the new ones. I suggest that you do some balancing for the characters also rather than just adding more 5* characters and making the old ones not used. For example, buffs and nerfs or balances, don't just focus on buffs, it'll still probably ruin the game or still power creep some 5* characters.",5,2025-04-01 22:21:45

"I've been playing HSR since day one and love the game but I'm disappointed with the global passive system. HSR is a team-building game so why add account-wide buffs? I’m fine with revive buff but they should only work if the character is in the team. If more units get this, players who pulled for them will have unfair advantages and gameplay showcases will feel disconnected. The game is slowly shifting to pull-to-win instead of strategic team-building.",1,2025-04-01 19:12:34

Predatory Top Up Scheme,1,2025-04-01 18:49:21
"Its a good game until u reach 2.5 story and content the moment you hit that, it turn to a very bad game, story telling is awful, characters have no expression, story itself feels numb, and you can't stick to a character and invest in it bc the game has crazy power creep in it, the new character you obtain will be good for two patches max, after that it falls significantly in term of dmg, the banners are so predatory, the events are just some childish and have no context of story wise",2,2025-04-01 18:45:16

giving a global passive for upcoming charather just ruin the game,1,2025-04-01 18:38:31
Pay to win -game. They've outdone themselves by implementing account wide passives locked behind $300 characters (each). The most disrespectful and disgusting thing I've seen from these big gacha games.,2,2025-04-01 18:38:00
"ngawur banget cara update gamenya, karakter limited cepat sekali tidak terpakai karena setelah 2 patch tidak ada konten untuk karakter bisa dipakai. Kit karakter tidak bisa cocok dengan konten baru yang ada... serakah banget",1,2025-04-01 18:34:28
"Its good game and if anyone think global passive is worst, they messed up a lot. Everyone that said if pull castorice you don't have backbone, they are the one who doesn't have it. They are the one who doesn't want to embrace that new thing brought by developer. Lastly, everyone can play the way they want, and it is good to not say a bad thing about this game that they impose upon others and corrupt the beautiful and enjoyable community with their way of thinking. Thank you so much everyone👍",5,2025-04-01 18:30:29
"The BEST game it's sooo entertaining and also the rewards and luck are not normal it's much better than Genshin Impact its space is good its story is beautiful its characters are captivating and there are a lot of rewards and endless events some people will find the way of fighting boring, but I don't have a problem with it it's NOT as advanced as some other GAMES I know",5,2025-04-01 18:21:13

"I’ve really enjoyed this game since version 1.0 up until 2.0. The casual gameplay and engaging story were the main reasons I loved it. However, after the 3.0 update, it feels like the focus has shifted entirely to introducing new characters. It now seems like players are being pushed to gacha for every new character just to fully enjoy the game, which is disappointing. I don’t think this kind of marketing will attract new players. Even worse, it may drive away loyal players who have supported",2,2025-04-01 17:25:53

Every patch, game releases 2 5-stars, and seldomly releases 4-stars. HP boss inflation is hard to keep up. It is so bad that it can pressure players to do invest more just to increase their units' shell life. Story is boring. It's filled with heavy exposition with no skip button.

"I played for quite a while and enjoyed the game until Penacony. Ever since they introduced Super Break, everything went downhill with the enemy power scales and character power creep. the characters I built up became useless and I don't want to waste my time with this game anymore. With 3.0's release, everything crashed as in with my outdated character and disgustingly casual game time (play once a week or so), I can't catch up and can't complete any endgame for resources. So yeah, it ain't good",1,2025-04-01 14:01:57
"The 3.2 update is the worst. You try to cover it by giving out free 30 pulls and a free limited char but thats not gonna work. Global passive is just one of your dirty trick to make us pull the char. The amphoreus story is bland, long and complicated. The latest divergent universe is suck cuz of the pointless day and night mechanic and it also based on luck. Older char will be buffed in 3.4, I don't think it will fixed the issue of powercreep.

"This is the year I'm finally dropping this game, thanks to them doubling down on powercreeping characters with the introduction of global passive. Which basically buffs your gameplay by simply having that character in your account. At that point, it's no longer about mix and matching teams, it's about who you have in your account. Not to mention the lackluster presentation in the story telling that has not improved since the game's release. Avoid.",1,2025-04-01 13:45:08

"Love the characters, love the world design. My fave game that hoyo has created. Although I must admit that power creep has became ridiculous since 1.0 . About the global passive, I have no problem about it overall but my only issue is that the global passive still activates when the character isn't even in the team slot. This also implies that you guys' will make bosses or even world monsters even more powerful and may potentially end our team way faster than before. It's unnecessary.",3,2025-04-01 13:35:44

"this game looks good at the first glance, but if you've been playing this game for quite a long time, you will likely notice this game flaws.

"Horrible game, so many predatory practices..... I can't use my old characters and now they're thinking of adding global passives which makes having old characters totally pointless. Powercreep killed this game. Also the dialogue animations suck they're basic. Storytelling is horrible and gameplay is unintuitive and becomes boring pretty quick. edit: they added the global passives it's so over",1,2025-04-01 05:08:21
"I had an ""It's amazing"" review and kept it 5 stars throughout the 2 years I've played this game. However, I have to agree, Hoyoverse does it again with the stale endgame, and it didn't even take them that long to implement it. Really horrible HP inflation, metas where you need to pull specific characters that can buff your team even when they're not on your team, and the list will go on. I hope they realise their mistakes, but it's sad, as history repeated itself, but even worse.",2,2025-04-01 05:05:16
"boring story 75% of the time characters stand in a circle, yapping about nothing impactful towards the climax, the story is directionless until you past the 60% complete mark.

"The game was so good back in 1.x and 2.x. Now it's been ruined by corporate greed. The game opperates like a garbage D-tier gacha now. Insane powercreep, global passives while not even having the character on your team, near-mandatory eidolons (which require you to pull characters multiple times), infinite relic grind... The list goes on. Leaving a 1 star review so Mihoyo hopefully wakes the fk up. Love the game, but i can't recommend it in its current state. Play an actual game instead.",1,2025-04-01 04:50:17

It went from a game I thuroughly enjoyed and really loved playing into a predatory game where it feels like you must pull the newest character to a tualy have a chance at clearing content. It's sad seeing that my favorite characters constantly get forgotten and powercrept. And don't get me started on global passives coming in new patches. Way to ruin a genuanly fun game.,1,2025-04-01 04:43:14
"Started version 1.5 and was really enjoying the game, extremely excited for the release of Penacony. Fast forward and HSR has fallen incredibly flat in 3.1. The story telling in HSR has been very lack luster with characters often standing in circles yapping. Powercreep is so excessive that the characters I pulled in early/mid version 2 are obsolete now. Events these days are hilariously short and uninteresting. Hoyo makes so much $ and yet returns slop. 500 character limit cuts 2/3 of my review",1,2025-04-01 04:42:29

"Having played the game since 1.1 (6 weeks after release) I am changing my previous 5* review to a single star to reflect the hugely unpopular move the devs have taken by ignoring the warnings of beta testers and implementing a predatory, very much p2w global passive system. They muted/deleted all talk of it on their Hoyolab app. This is a team building game and global passives are antithetical to that. Don't waste your time or money.

day 1 player who dropped the game during 3.0. powercreep has ruined the game. unless your a whale spender or only play for story and don't care about missing rewards from end game content just stay away. global passives will also slowly kill this game along with the powercreep. hoyo doesn't listen to feedback either. use to love this game but no longer.,1,2025-04-01 02:04:22

"This game becomes more thirsty for money. It's slowly turning to a P2W. With every update, they will powercreep old characters with new characters, effectively forcing us to pull for characters we don't want. Sure, they have better treatment for rewards and all, but it's not worth the effort and time for the amount of pulls we have to make just to clear endgame contents.

"It used to be a great side gacha game with contents filled with passion in the early patches, but the game hit steady decline in quality for main story quest and events from patch 2.4 until the patch 3.1 when this review released. The game is kinda okay if you play it really casually as a side gacha and don't mind the occasional content drought. The daily is quick and the events are easy.

"Update: I'm changing my review from a 5 to a 1. everything I praised the game for before? take it all back. the devs have ruined this game with unrelenting power creep and the story telling is the worst it could possibly be, especially for a billion dollar company. The rewards feel lack luster compared to the pace that the game releases meta defining units. Now they have released a limited character with a global passive... In the end, Hoyoverse will never be a trustworthy company.",1,2025-03-31 21:21:46
"Game had potential, but powercreep has gone out of control over the last year, older characters are pretty much useless now, and they're making it even worse with the addition of global passives on new characters, increasing FOMO to unbelievable levels, now you don't get to choose which character to pull, Hoyo forces them down your throat and you either get them, or you miss out on buffs for your entire account.

Remove the GLOBAL PASSIVESKIL. as much as I love this game I feel like the new global passive skill is just going to make the game p2w and a whole lotta worse as if the power creep wasn't enough this just added a whole new layer to it . another problem Is the lack of cutscenes or any character movement on the MAIN story quest if it was the side quest or anything it would've been tolerable but it isn't.,1,2025-03-31 19:46:55

Very fast pace of powercreep.New Characters you pull today will be useless in less than 6 months.Budget put into animations is not upto standard considering the amount of money this game makes.,1,2025-03-31 16:10:50
i used to play this game every school holiday even tho i live in dorm but then i stopped playing it when i realised the power creep is getting way to worse. power creep and the pulls is getting harder. there was a time I tried pulling for a certain character a bit easier(and I don't want to talk about when they did 3 rerun banner at the same time) .[obviously lost the banner] the current ver is as hard/bad as genshin. pls hoyo not hsr since I already spent most of my money in it.,1,2025-03-31 16:10:06
The greediest game developers in the industry. time and time again all they do is add the scummiest monetization practices into the game and try to cover it up with a few extra pulls. Adding global passives to the game is too scummy to overlook. 0/5 do not recommend.,1,2025-03-31 16:09:15

"This game was phenomenal back when it launched, but now, with the Castorice global passive, it seems like the devs have decided to take the scummy route. Many players don't realize that this could potentially lead to more powerful global passives from future characters, and in turn, players will feel like their missing out if they don't get the new shiny unit even if its a char they dont like. It's really sad to see the direction that this game went, considering how much I enjoyed playing it.",1,2025-03-31 15:58:29

This game is visually great but after 2 years it is clear that the game will end service soon with the decisions the development team are making. greedy for money and that is reflected in the Health inflation in end game so you spend that coin in the new characters or you are left behind because you simply can't clear end game. Do not pull reruns of characters because after the first run they are just bad after 2 pach later where you need the new characters. Just don't lose your time with it.,1,2025-03-31 15:47:11

"It's been a good run, they flew too close to the sun with this upcoming patch. They have decided to implement a system that makes it necessary to pull new characters otherwise your account will be weaker for it in a huge way. Honestly would say if you see a game and it says hoyo on it, steer clear. They start each game out strong then let it rot as they work on their next game to bait ppl with. Content has gotten sloppier in HSR and predatory practices stronger. This used to be a 4 star review.",1,2025-03-31 15:44:04

"Huge power creep problem that devs address by inflating mob hp, making old units laughably useless compared to new units. They have started adding global passives meaning in the future they will add units that have strong global passives that will give you an advantage only if you pull them (doesn't have to be in team) . This combination makes the game even more predatory than Genshin. Lots of anniversary events that incentivise spending. HSR used to be good. Shaoji is a terrible story writer.",1,2025-03-31 15:38:26

Honkai Star Rail recently introduced a mechanic that basically will force you to pull for new characters for buffs that are given to any of your future teams and characters. This is very unhealthy and will force you to pull for characters you may not want but need to play all the content in the game. Due to this the game is in a bad spot and is currently not worth playing unless these passives are given in a different way. I do not recommend playing unless you don't mind being forced to pull,1,2025-03-31 14:51:34

The game is powercreeping too much already before that and we don't need a reason to just pull characters for their global passives, there will exist characters that we just pull for that in the future, castorice is already sellable even before that.

"The game punishes you for not caring for meta. I know my team comp is bad, I know my build is too, but when I hit a roadblock, I know to better my team. No matter what you do, it won't help cuz you NEED the team to be meta. If I can simply raise my characters level to just pass (like every other game), I can just continue the game with no problem. I don't see people mention this, but I feel Acheron was power creeped when Firefly released. TL;DR This game is for people who care for teambuilding",1,2025-03-31 13:23:32

Coming from a previous lover:This game was good in the honeymoon period. But now I would say don't even try it unless you are ok with only your favourite character and even if they are half baked with kits. cause surprise : They need other characters or multiple copies to even function. And by function I mean smooth play. And if you come for story. Just go to YouTube and get a overview of it. The story telling is horrible. 1 hour puzzle only to realize it nothing to do story.only drag playtime,1,2025-03-31 12:01:23

That means the player doesn't have a substitute for all of these 5 star characters that they're missing on, because they keep releasing these premium 5 star characters with the sole purpose of ONLY powercreeping the previous 'premium' characters.",2,2025-03-31 10:22:22

"the most predatory gacha in the market, also the worst turn based game there is characters completely disregard the systems in the game and just hit the auto button if you were looking for a turn based game this isn't it",1,2025-03-30 22:58:45

"Global passives in gacha games disrupt balance by favoring specific characters, limiting diverse/creative team building which is basically the building block of turn based game like hsr. this pressure players into chasing certain units to stay competitive, making the experience feel like pay-to-win rather than skillful gameplay. Casual players are often alienated by this system, eroding the community's vibrancy and diminishing creativity in team-building.",1,2025-03-30 21:52:01

"would be fun if the end game content isn't annoying, older 5*s arent majorly powercrept, no hp inflation, skip button, better storytelling, no annoying enemy mechanics that needs you to pull certain characters to be comfortable. Even if you did get ruan mei youd probably still end up frustrated if you dont got the new guys. Plus the global passives mean their continuing digging their own grave.",1,2025-03-30 19:46:21

"Game ini lebih cocok disebut simulator nonton dialog daripada RPG. Nggak ada tombol skip, tiap karakter doyan yapping nggak kelar-kelar, dan storytelling-nya? Astaga, kayak nonton sinetron FTV murahan. Kalau saya mau baca novel, saya buka buku, bukan main game. Tolong kasih opsi skip atau setidaknya ringkas ceritanya, biar kita nggak ketiduran sebelum gameplay-nya mulai. 1 bintang dulu sampai dev sadar kalau pemain itu pengen main, bukan disuruh jadi audiens podcast NPC!!",1,2025-03-30 16:11:45

"im playing this game since day one and today, i quit. not just this game but all of the games from Mihoyo. the quality is not improving(cutscenes and storytelling), the game is being greedy and most of all,they avoid players feedback to justify their plans on cashing every dime out of the player base.

5 star 🌟 immediately the storytelling awesome the Voice Actress and Actor is wonderful and Gameplay Mechanics are Cazry love it thats i care i will continue playing this game until the very end just don't replace the Voice Actress with AI no emotion robot perfect pitch one i dont care about knowing someone out there a real human voicing my favorite character makes me feel all the emotions of the story nothing beats human to human connection and that a fact keep updating the game dont be greedy,5,2025-03-30 15:36:48
amazing game with beautiful character designs the Voice actor's are amazing the story line is amazing the cut scene are so well made and well thought out the games developers are so generous the rewards are amazing and the anniversary event each year always brings so many gifts,5,2025-03-30 15:34:46

"If you want to pick this game up, dont, the devs dont respect you for loving and enjoying the game, they only cater to BIG spenders that can get the latest characters plus their weapons and duplicates and, yes not even monthly pass players have a good time save yourself the hassle and play better games, dont start a toxic gaming relationship with a game like this made by people who only view their player base as atms",2,2025-03-30 15:16:14

it's about the 3.2 new character. you know it already why it's 1 star!,1,2025-03-30 15:02:01
"Changing my review from 5 to 1. Character shouldn't have global passive. This precedent case marks the downfall of this game. From Genshin to Star Rail, will ZZZ go down the same way? Only time will tell. Predatory practices will not be supported.",1,2025-03-30 14:53:29
Despite the recent issues with the English voice actors striking to protect them selves from AI and subsequent studio change. Honkai Star Rail is a fun RPG set in a futuristic world where people have spread out all across the cosmos. The story is so rich with enjoyable twists and turns as well as amazing characters to back up it's already great story. Each character truly feels like it's own person and despite its focus on meta and money (like all gacha games) you can't help but play more.,5,2025-03-30 14:40:59
powercreep is horrendous. you pull units that will lose value faster than a newly bought car.,1,2025-03-30 14:23:57

"The game is so amazing on it's own even tho I'm not into turn-based game player. Updates are nice, contents are amazing overalll it's peak game!!! About global passive of castorice, i think it's actually unfair for other older character so maybe i hope they add a passive when those two or more are in teams together for example when robin and sunday they got some buffs ❤ or maybe more global passive for stronger characters in lore...",5,2025-03-30 14:12:29

"Hello, I enjoy playing Honkai: Star Rail, but the new Global Passive from Castorice makes older characters feel weak. The difficulty spike and HP inflation force players to pull for new units, making past investments feel pointless. Please consider balancing adjustments to keep older characters viable.

One of the best games I've ever played sure it has its issues but what games don't? it's the flaws that show even a good games needs improvement and their even trying to buff old charecters though we don't have to much info on it yet the story is incredible and captivating with amazing cutscenes and awesome game play,5,2025-03-30 13:25:23

"The greediness is insane—limited banners, expensive pulls, and barely any free rewards. Plus, global passives force you to pull for meta units just to keep up.

"I enjoyed the game, till it became more and more soulless. Probably the best 1.0 of any gacha game out there, and from that point it was a slippery slope. Now we're here where the developers have put in some of the most predatory monetisation I have ever seen in ANY GAME, global passives on characters that you're not guaranteed to get unless you save for 3 months is crazy.

"The powercreep is unbelievably bad. A new character comes out and they're basically powercreept by the time they rerun.

"Global passive ruined it, thanks",1,2025-03-30 09:24:01
"The Powercreep in this game, Combined with designing every aspect of new content around making the new character look as good as possible means that it's very hard to enjoy the game if you're not using the hot new character, or several extremely Overpowered characters. Combine this with a lack of events and a story that, while good, can very easily yap for too long with no way to skip the more boring parts. and you have that you will enjoy in the short term, but not for long",2,2025-03-30 08:52:24

Predatory p2w practices that are getting increasingly worse.,1,2025-03-30 08:24:39
Here we are going into 3.2 I have been an everyday player since 1.1 Silver wolfs banner. I gave this game 5 stars all the way up until this point. Of course like every game it had its ups and downs but I still enjoyed logging in and playing my 30 min daily. But after the 3.2 Live I can say the Devs slapped us in the face with big floppy Dongs and expected us to thank them. I highly suggest everyone uninstall the game until they can prove that they aren't gonna make another Genshin mistake.,1,2025-03-30 07:44:29

"My review used to be 5-stars but remove global passives, y'all are becoming the embodiment of greed. Is the top of the monthly revenue not enough for you all? Do you all need even more yachts?

Powercreep and greed ruined this wonderful game,1,2025-03-30 06:45:36
It's sad to see a game that I like slowly kill itself because the devs are so eager to push through with powercreep that we don't need. If they ever want to implement powercreep they could do so in a way that doesn't make everyone abandon old units for new ones especially with the global passives. If they ever wish to go forward with this they might as well implement global passives for every other character released prior to Castorice to keep things fair but knowing Hoyo they probably wouldn't.,1,2025-03-30 06:41:00

"I had to drop my previous rating of 5* because of the way the game is going now. a character whose skill is automatic. A global passive skill that works even when the character is not on the team. The big HP inflation on end game that makes you pull for the newest character. The lack of usage of older units, which I still adore but cannot use because they are weak.

The new characters are just so stunning and I love their playstyles. The end game is okay, but could be more. The events are limited but much better than Genshin so I think it is fine.

"The new update will add Bluetooth passives. Basically, as long as your account has the character ""Castorice"" obtained (and yes, I mean obtained not on the team or in the fight) your characters can revive themselves therefore prolonging their existence even after dying for an extra turn, unless they get healed during this duration, then the limit of having only one turn dissappears.

The gacha rates are awful, making it nearly impossible to get good characters without spending tons of money, only for them to become obsolete due to power creep. Gameplay is repetitive, with shallow combat and an exhausting grind locked behind an energy system that limits progress. The story drags with excessive, unskippable dialogue. Monetization ruins the experience, proving it prioritizes profit over fun. Avoid this game entirely.",1,2025-03-30 00:12:12
"Sorry to say, but this game was much better around when it first released. First of all, takes up alot of storage, which is expected but this game is better off playing on a PC or a PS5.

I've played this game for months now and overall I've had a good experience but it hasn't lasted long. The powercreep has become ridiculous making older characters basically useless in the game. With the new global buff invited to the game its made the entire state of the game worse and even more predatory than before. Its practically unplayable and just getting worse as you're forced to get newer characters just to keep up. It was fun while it lasted but I do not recommend it anymore.,2,2025-03-29 22:32:03

"I changed my mind. Not fun anymore to invest your time and money. I play games just for fun and I pull for characters that I like.

The game had cool story and animations at the start but as time went on it became clear the developers were only interested in adding more predatory features and distracting player with in game gifts instead of fixing issues mentioned in player feedback forms. global passives especially are a clear sign that they have no intention of slowing down these predatory practices. it would be sad when this spreads to other games.,1,2025-03-29 12:29:54
"A game that delivers an uninspiring story and is stingy in their presentation of their 'deep lore' despite being a multi-billion dollar company who is also relentless in their power creep journey to make every unit easily replaceable and much better than the last by unacceptable metrics while not helping older units keep up. the content in each patch is anemic, and despite this they continue to recycle 'events' that are mind numbingly boring",1,2025-03-29 12:20:56

If you're looking for a bed time story just listen to the dialogue. Also was gonna come back for anniversary but NO the greed is real. It's an anniversary where the player base is rewarding the devs for garbage by topping off to get a new broken fomo character that literally opens a new door to a system they'll exploit more fomo through this.

Lacks an auto-clear function so the daily grind feels padded out even with maxed characters. Story has a lot of word bloat, network issues are constant and they restart the current story segment. NPC animations are especially lackluster as well. Would not recommend if you're F2P and want to consistently clear content.",1,2025-03-29 10:29:03

Still refuse to add a skip button( a qol already in the game but locked behind repeat dialogue).

Sure, a revive is nothing now, but wait until we get a character that buffs SPD just for having them in your account.

It's good,5,2025-03-29 04:22:29
"I wish powercreep was not so apparent, but in other matters this game is very cool! Nice QoL, easy to farm when you have to do other stuff (due to optional autobattle), large amount of free currency for gacha pulls. Also story is pretty consistent, i like how various fractions interact within this universe",4,2025-03-29 04:21:44
Game's pretty unique but has been slowly being very predatory.,1,2025-03-29 04:12:13
"Great game, except there are no events, your characters will be outdated in 2 patches, they stopped making 4 stars, and any progress you think they are making to improve the game is offset by 10 more terrible decisions. It's like they gave up on improving the game until enough people get mad, then they show the smallest amount of change only to go back to their old ways again. Honestly not worth seriously investing time or money into.",1,2025-03-29 04:07:19
"Great game overall, but there seems to be an overwhelming number of 5-star releases lately, and not enough 4-stars. The global passive is going to be really frustrating if you don’t want to summon for that particular character, or you’ll have to pull for that global passive. The question remains about what the next global passive will be, especially if they intend to introduce more of them. I enjoy the game, but I dislike the grind and map exploration in turn-based games. 4.8/10",2,2025-03-29 04:06:18
The game is not for casuals finishing first major stroy mission took me days and there's no option to skip unnecessary dialogue and there are way too many of them,1,2025-03-29 04:05:57
my review used to praise the game but the global passives make me sad,1,2025-03-29 04:04:18
"Dropped from 3 stars to 1. Hoyo continues to be totally oblivious and refuses to add a skip button, so I have to waste my time watching unskippable dialogue written by a 5th grader just to get to the next part of gameplay. Speaking of gameplay, the difficulty continues to rise across the board, and you're basically screwed if you're not willing to pull the newest, shiniest character that was specifically designed to counter the current content. I guess that nuclear reactor won't pay for itself.",1,2025-03-29 03:57:44
"honestly, this is my favourite Gacha game of all time. I've played about 10 gacha games, and this one tops em all. Hsr is pretty generous with rewards and jades, and in my opinion, the most generous of all the other hoyo games. It has permanent events that give you plenty of Jades, and it also makes regular events that give you limited time rewards, which give you about 10 pulls each event. It has great animations, character design, and story. I definitely recommend it, 10/10 game.",5,2025-03-29 03:53:18
"The powercreep in this game is insane. To clear content, you need every brand new shiny 5 star. Now, if you don't pull for Castorice, you lose a universal buff. Hoyo needs to remove universal buffs tied to premium characters you need to spend money on to get.",1,2025-03-29 03:52:18
"Killed the game by pure greed. 0 content, 0 effort, disrespecting players time, absurd powercreep making the characters you spent months on obsolete, ignore community feedback as long as it doesnt hurt their sales, purely proft driven souless game",1,2025-03-29 03:42:00
"global account buff for owning a character is horrendous. no artifact load outs, no skip button, and terrible story presentation.",1,2025-03-29 03:34:53
"With the introduction of global passives simply for having characters on your account, I have quit HSR and will never play another Hoyo game as long as I live. Literally one of the most greedy companies I have ever seen. I wish I hadn't wasted so much time playing a game the devs are actively ruining because of greed.",1,2025-03-29 03:31:31
This game has an issue of pure powercreep/feature creep & Hp inflation. Certain characters basically get phased out and completely invalidated to new characters even at E6. Content hasn't become harder due to strategy or gimmicks it became tedious with hp inflation. And the feature creep has become so ridiculous we have global passives in Castorice and units having a 2.0v of an old kit. Ex: Mydei & Blade & Silver Wolf & Anaxa. Steer clear from Hoyo games as a whole. Starts decent/good turns bad.,1,2025-03-29 03:25:10
"Powercreep galore, shilling new unit endgame, subpar story with even worse story telling that is unskipable, tone deaf dev, the list goes on edit : p2w global passive, outstanding move hoyo, hope your sheep is fat enough to last you for a long time cause this is the last straw for me",1,2025-03-29 03:23:04
"a game that delivers an uninspiring story and is stingy in their presentation of their 'deep lore' despite being a multi-billion dollar company who is also relentless in their powercreep journey to make every unit easily replaceable and much better than the last by obscene metrics while not helping older units keep up. the content in each patch is anemic, and despite this they continue to recycle 'events' that are mind numbingly borin. Go play something else. Go play GFL2 Exilium instead.",1,2025-03-29 03:23:02

"The powercreep is a REALLY big issue. I rarely pull for characters because I am f2p (free to play), and it gets harder every patch to play the game because new characters just keep getting stronger, and the bosses keep getting harder and more hp.",1,2025-03-29 02:45:34
Spent $600 on this game and can't clear content to the fullest. My units feel weaker because of the HP inflation and restrictive buffs. Game moved from turned based rpg gacha to just a gacha game. Selling you full teams but no compensation - decent f2p options for the new Remeberance path and Acheron. Have to pull for signatures now for most of these units. Storytelling is terrible but the lore is good. Barely any content & fast powecreep.,2,2025-03-29 02:43:09

Its money tycoon at this point,1,2025-03-29 02:09:21
This game is one of the best games I've ever played the story is interesting but the only thing bothering me is that there's so skip button especially for long world quests. It has beautiful graphics you can find many friends and save for your fav characters and gameplay isn't too hard to understand either and I'm also going the mention the amount of in-game content you can do when you start playing... I'm satisfied...as for the skip button...well,5,2025-03-29 02:04:35

I want to play Jing Yuan, Dan Heng IL and Qingque but I have to play The Herta, Rappa or Firefly just to keep up with the meta, and this is before Castorice who I am pulling for just because of her Global Passive and other Powercreep reasons.

Why is the game like this Hoyo?",1,2025-03-28 20:00:56
"Don't waste time or money. Used to be my favorite game, now I'm just forced to see it crash and burn. The addition of global passives is going to change the game design and meta forever, turning it into a predatory cash grab, and no amount of ""free 5 star characters"" is going to change that. They are just trying to distract the players from the burning trash pile that is the endgame. The story is lazy and boring, the characters are 1-dimensional and immediately powercrept.

The global revive passive on Castorice is a blatant and outright insult to the state of the game in its rampant powercreep that the community has spoken out against very loudly.

"Honestly, this game and the devs are pathetic. Favoritism, Predatory behavior, no skip button, terrible writing, money hungry devs. This game has it all. Hoyo barely gives players enough pulls to get one five star yet they release 2 five stars, per patch and you need the other character to play the first one.

this game is so frustrating all the characters get powercrept they actively punish you for skipping characters and it is extremely hard to clear endgame without the new op characters who will probably be powercrept in 2 or 3 pathches until the next op character comes this is just rinse and repeat i advise you to not start the game I will update this if they finally start listening to players and make the game good,1,2025-03-28 15:05:49
"yeah this game is cooked, they don't know how to balance their character and now we haven't seen a new affordable 4 star. if you consider playing this game, run. this game became more and more money hungry towards their player, i play for 2+ year and the shift meta was very subtle. they bring a strong character that makes old character struggling to keep up because they need to raise the enemy scale so that the new character can't one shot the character. keep raise the number and lack creativity",1,2025-03-28 15:00:40

"The game is fun. I love the storyline and animation. Very lively. But it is very not F2P. Once you get the character you wanted, the character might not be used as patches later due to powercreep.

"As someone who played from the start of this game's release, I feel like the powercreep is getting more ridiculous each time there is an update. The fact that they have more 5 stars than 4 stars also sums it. I also don't get the mistreatment this game gives to male characters. They deserve some love too. Giving one star until our voice is heard, or I will consider uninstalling and play other games instead.",1,2025-03-28 14:48:50

been playing since the release and the balancing in this game is so bad now. can barely use my 1.x characters now.,1,2025-03-28 08:27:09
just like the other comments. game has really been boring and pointless overall. nothing to keep up with the current market compared to other gacha games. I know the game is a RPG mechanic but the power scaling for older limited units is just too despairing honestly. even when they announce they will buff older units to meet current meta it makes me mad that it has to come to this. the game has the logic where more hp=more difficult content. you will be fighting sponges by the time the game EOS.,1,2025-03-28 08:22:44

"While I enjoy playing this game, it's frustrating how quickly early 5-star limited characters become irrelevant compared to Genshin Impact. You're basically forced to chase the meta with every new patch to clear endgame content. Genshin, on the other hand, lets you use teams like the National team from 1.0 in Spiral Abyss. And to top it off, this new version has no new 4-star characters. I've spent a lot of money, and I'm seriously reconsidering any further in-game purchases.",2,2025-03-28 08:06:10

"This game was great the first year and even into 2.0 besides power creep but I cannot advise anyone to play it right now if you really want to get immersed into it. It's a pretty predatory gacha at this point.

"I loved HSR at release and during the first year. The game seemed so fun back then with character hangouts, interactive events, and amazing characters. Ever since then HSR has been on a constant decline. The predatory gacha is worse than any other gacha games, it's a barrage of 5* characters, the events are far spaced out and there's some new level of endgame hell.

"While i still enjoy the game and its story in the recent updates, it still at some points feels slow between updates with events that are not really engaging.

Powercreep to the point where pulling for characters that are released 6 months ago is pointless. Dialogue is so bloated the main quest takes up 10 hours of your time.

the game didn't even opened. first they scammed by giving approximately 2.5GB resource pack. and then after downloading the resource pack the screen stayed blank and nothing happened,1,2025-03-26 01:54:07

"New gacha system is way more predatory than the last. Powercreep that makes most of the old character redundant especially with the latest content tailored to them. Story scenes are lackluster with black screen and white text for many scenes. Slight improvement in the newer patch but hopefully they only focus on improving and not revert.

I would give it 1 star just for graphics and gameplay style cause I literally agree with other reviews that recent updates are making each character powercreep like unless you don't have these you can't keep up with the content and the bosses and game modes where enemies hp is increased only because of the recent powercreep when I installed I liked this game and deleted this after the recent updates.Additionally the pity system is making me loose more frequently .,1,2025-03-24 22:57:22

"I have noticed that the skip button only appears when a scene plays out again, but when a new scene plays out that hasn't been played before, there is no skip button. I reroll a lot to pull for different characters in different accounts, but because of the dialogues, my patience runs out before I could even finish the tutorial. I have already finished the story, so I would appreciate it if I don't have to go through the story again and just skip all of the dialogues. This would be very helpful.",1,2025-03-24 16:48:07

Creativity is out of the picture, you can just tell the game is in its ""cash cow"" phase now. They're gonna do the bare minimum to maintain and retain the current playerbase.

I am pretty new to this game and it has really good graphics and ideas. it has some long dialogues and texts to go through but it is kinda necessary for the experience . new characters with really great designs and personalities that I liked and despite people nagging about how they don't like where the game is going it's just their overly unachievable expectations. but I still love the game though the issue with ho inflation in end game content is kinda hard to ignore,5,2025-03-24 07:08:32

"After playing this game for over a year I must express my disappointment for the direction the gameplay is taking. 1) HP-Inflation: clearing endgame content without the latest meta character is nearly impossible. 2) Bias for female characters: male characters are not as strong or have lazier animations. Just look at upcoming characters Castorice and Anaxa. Anaxa has repeated animations! Depsite having a lackluster kit at best, he got nerfed to smithereens in V6! Blatant bias is being shown here.",1,2025-03-23 15:55:58

"One of the best Gacha games I've played. The primary issue for me is that the rates are very rough and Hoyo likes to release characters that syergize well with each other very close to each other making it extremely difficult to build a proper team around your favorite characters. I prefer to play how I want with who I want and still make progress but it is quite difficult with HSR.

"I enjoyed this game until its weird account level gatekeeping killed the fun. I was having fun doing the main story, but then suddenly while you're in the middle of the story it just abruptly interrupts you to tell you to go grind side quests and dailies before you're allowed to progress the story, because your account level isn't high enough. Really immersion breaking and completely kills the fun. Makes the game suddenly feel like homework. I immediately uninstalled.",2,2025-03-23 01:41:51

There's too much focus on new character backstories instead of progressing the main plot. The excessive dialogue breaks immersion, making it hard to stay invested.

I love the game but Jesus christ if you are interested in the story you will read more than you read in university. The story is long and most of the time it has so much useless information it's insane. I feel I am reading more than I am playing. Relic farming is insanely boring and rng is always against you.

"This game used to be one of my favorite gacha games but it seems like it's just going downhill. With the more recent 3.0 story updates, it just feels like the story has pointless filler to pad out the run time. It's a JRPG, it should be up to the player to pad out the run time by doing side quests, not the main story. Grinding for materials/relics needs to be reworked. It's taking too long with luck based dropped. That should be the gacha, not equipment. Silent English dub is a bad sign too.",3,2025-03-21 21:01:43

I loved this game all the way through v2 but the enemy HP bloat and the absolute NEED for the newest character to clear the endgame means your 100-300 dollar character is not going to perform the way you'd expect such an investment to do so.

Second, the ""gameplay"". There's nothing, really, anything worthwhile playing this game for the gameplay. And with the recent update, powercreep is not the only thing you would worry about.

"Very predatory and not in a good place. 90% of events are dull and the other 10% are mediocre. If you want to clear lategame content with your favourite team that isn't 'the current thing', spend money. Story is all filler until a cutscene that hypes up the climax and then more filler. You can find better stories in the side quest then the main story, and even then it's nothing that special. Spend money or play for months to get a team that will be mediocre in a couple months (sometimes sooner).",1,2025-03-20 22:05:01

Amazing game literally at everything the characters the animations the music the fights the story heck they give you free rewards on your birthday and each time they give lots of rewards in every event and on top with an OP character this game deserves 5 stars in total but sadly it got 4.2 i don't know why also you might want a strong phone because even my phone an infinix note 40 pro with 16 ram is struggling at medium graphics buy a strong phone or use a cooling fan on your midrange phone👍,5,2025-03-16 02:54:38

"2025 Edit: The game is worth playing up until 3.0. After GI, I can safely say this is where the game goes into ""maintenance"" mode and doesn't innovate, expand, or explore. Hope I'm wrong, but waiting 3+ months for a game to maybe get good is insane. A fantastic game. The second story arc is weak, but the events and gameplay are phenomenal and the voice acting is stellar. Leaps and bounds better than GI in terms of QoL and improvements.",3,2025-03-15 14:30:25

This game will become your side job (just do dailies and spend energy, time waste), NPCs design are beyond worse even the main character lacks facial expressions. Better try Wuthering Waves or wait for other upcoming gacha games instead of wasting your time on the Honkai Powercreep Rail",1,2025-03-11 20:02:38
It's not you who killed this game it's the game who killed itself. I will keep on playing this game for now if things keep on getting like this. The hole game is doomed HSR. More like disappointment star.,1,2025-03-11 19:47:19
"This game used to be very fun but recent developments have shown that fun is gone. If global passives land like the beta implies and work in the endgame, its only a matter of time before it hurts other gacha.

"One of the game that attracts me from the trailer. but yeah,my opinion change after play 3.0 quest...why after penacony,they so lazy,if something happen,they didnt give cutscene,they just show a blank screen and word. at first it was cool,but now to repetitive and lazy,what the hell happen HSR. i will play this game,but will not have the same passion i have when it was one of my best game.

"I'm giving you all a 5 star rating solely because of how good Hoyo's games have been with me. I got my Sunday in 2 pulls when he came out. And I just got Tribbie on my best friend's account. I've only lost about 3 50/50s. When Yunli came out, I got her in 25 pulls, then I got Huohuo in the next 20. Best game ever >.<",5,2025-03-11 12:19:11
"Don't play it, I know powercreep is inevitable for tactical RPGs, because Fire Emblem Heroes did it first. But it's disgustingly greedy to put insanely busted buffs behind a paywall to get more people to spend. I uninstalled a few weeks ago due to the news and I have no intention of returning. What's the point if there's no point in using the characters I pulled and really like if they're already irrelevant within the first couple years of the game?",1,2025-03-11 11:47:14

"The game progresses far too fast for a modern gacha, power creeping every 2 months. They're also trying to add a new global passive mechanic, which will only drive them further down a hole. The game needs to fix itself before people start quitting more than they already are.",1,2025-03-11 09:46:24

I played when it first came out and I still remember how silver wolf was said to be game changing. it's sad that my most favorite game became like this. Hoping this problem wouldn't bleed to ZZZ.",1,2025-03-11 09:05:58

Uninstalled story makes me sleepy and where is my skip button? Why is there no skip when wuwa has it at launch?,1,2025-03-11 03:03:48
Game has a massive powercreep problem that forces you to pull as many units as you can. Enemies have an allarmingly exponential HP growth with proggressively more stally mechanics because the endgame mode wants you to finish stages as fast as possible. Endgame is an endless amount of HP sponge enemies (3-4 million HP) who dopotato damage to you and just want to stall you out. Play this game for story and characters not for gameplay. Community may try to deny it but the game's direction is bad,1,2025-03-11 02:58:41

"Hello Mihoyo, I have a few suggestions that you can include for future updates. For example, the skip button for the side story feels necessary because not everyone has the time. If you skip the story, don't do it, it's not even fun, then try making a slot for the relic/planar set so you can change it, it's not complicated and the same is true in the team change section, like in Zzz, you can save the team so it's easier and the relic bag fills up faster so please increase the relic thank you",5,2025-03-10 09:35:30
"change my rating to 1 star because the 3.0 story telling is a hot garbage, you guys make around 40 million dollars every month yet you cant even make a proper animation for character and choose to use blackscreen instead of animating the scene.

Adding a global passives under a 300$ paywall is where I draw the line.,1,2025-03-10 03:46:05
"My 2 cents. Delete that powercreep strategy and implement paid skins. You'll make way more money with paid skins than you would by trying to force players into rolling for the newest characters out of necessity. If someone has been playing since launch they probably like the characters. If you make all the characters that someone fell in love with useless, then they will most likely quit. Skins wins. Powercreeping the characters everyone loves makes them quit.",5,2025-03-10 02:37:17

And with the upcoming patches all I can say is I'm not looking forward to any of an it, I just genuinely don't feel rewarded for my time and loyalty as a 1.0 player...",1,2025-03-09 22:56:14

"I used to love this game. I started playing back in version 1.4. Back then it was amazing and the story and gameplay pulled me in. However, the game has become frustratingly predatory with more and more updates. HP inflation of bosses from the endgame content is a joke, and you will be needing the new meta characters if you like to clear endgame content. And that's not all, you will be forced to pull for Eidolons to increase a character's overall performance. Hoyo being hoyo, greed takes over.",1,2025-03-09 21:53:32

The end content of the game is very hard. Plus some old characters already powercreep and cannot use it anymore.

- Very money greedy. Cannot max star newest endgame content (like Apocalyptic Shadow or Memory of Chaos) without pulling for all newest characters (and most of their light cones). - Pretty boring. Some turn based games are still fun even though the 'turn based' aspect makes creating fun content challenging. HSR is not one of them. Always the same thing.

Fix your game. Story is boring and just keep introducing 100 characters with shallow story writing. Every shiny new character powercreeps the previous every single patch.

Already deleted the game not finding any interesting things to do. The endgame content is too difficult even for a spender and impossible for f2p. Old characters are just useless and irrelevant and character u pull will definitely get powercreeped (overpowered) by another character within a month or two. Even some characters are only usefull if you have 2 or more copies of them which costs around 600-900 dollars. The story of amphoreus is just horrible and boring.

It's been a while since I played because of storage bloat (hopefully those at Hoyo can find a way to compact it) but from what I remember it is a lot of fun! FTP is actually an enjoyable experience unlike its sister title and the story pacing is traditional to RPGs. Though data is the major drawback and for a Gacha rpg it honestly can be worse.

"After 2 years, this game has been stagnant for so long. The dev barely put any effort in the story, which is the main part of the game, and u can't skip it. The game releases units fast and has massive power creep After billions of $ that this game generated. This is unacceptable. Try out Wuthering Waves or Limbus Company or even Tribenine. They are a much smaller company compared to Hoyo, and they generate less revenue. But they put out quality stuff and keep improving. Hoyo can never improve",1,2025-03-07 03:57:41

The game is fun. The gameplay is turn based mixed with some world exploration as well as fun minigames and sidequests. The characters are funny. Performance has started to get a little worse. I do have to sadly admit the game is starting to get a little boring. The latest quests just didn't get my attention as much as when Penacony was first introduced. Lately more characters no longer have a voice which is a result of the voice actors being treated unfair.,4,2025-03-06 12:41:22

"I downloaded this because a lot of my friends played at first, and I thought it was pretty fun. I really like the story and the turn-based combat! Unfortunately, recently, with new game modes and characters, I find the game to be life sucking and boring. It honestly feels like you NEED specific characters to pass some areas, no room for characters you actually like. The constant power-creep is also so tiring, no room to save for characters. I uninstalled and don't plan on playing again.",1,2025-03-03 00:18:05
Was a great game now just average as the power creep and predatory gatcha with limited currency is a thing in this game.,4,2025-03-02 23:30:05
"This game has the best lore out of any Hoyoverse game. Love the sci-fi space and divine power anime theme with bits of modern humor sprinkled in. Furthermore, this game has the best lore delivery because it is a turn-based battle system with room-based exploration, which makes the long dialogue blend in with everything else. If it were ""open world"" or an ""action RPG,"" then the long lore and dialogue would seem out of place from the open exploration or intense combat. Excellent job 👍",5,2025-03-02 23:10:12

Like when you are forced to extend your essay to meet the minimum word count. Certain Characters' stories overlapping the main story Overuse of element implant. Lacking shielder options.

I tried pulling the newer 'meta' characters, but the amount of time to build new characters is super long and extremely frustrating.

There's a good auto mode but powercreep is a major issue. Story is subpar. The first major planet is solid but it goes downhill fast from there. No skip button and slow text speed waste your time.

A new dps gets released almost every update, and they're rarely good for more than 1 update, and now they're trying to release a character that gives you a free revive as long as you own them.

"Honkai: Star Rail 3.0, is marred by significant issues that hinder player enjoyment. The absence of English voice lines already disrupts immersion, but the update also leans further into pay-to-win mechanics. Remember when farming was supposed to be challenging and rewarding? Now, with the purchase of the battle pass, players can lock two sub-stats, effectively removing a major grind element.

You promised no more powercreep and to buff old units. What did we get after that? Castorice beta V1? You must be kidding everyone. I have already uninstalled all of the games on every single platform. And I'm not installing any of these ever again. Hoyo has shown everyone what a corrupted heart they have and that they don't and never will care about players. Only thing they care about is how to sell their characters.

"The game itself is okay, but male characters are severely underpowered and not given good animations or fanservice.

As a day one player I feel greatly disappointed at seeing the horrendous autoplay and lackluster animations if mydei and currently in beta anaxa compared to castorice or aglaea.

I've played this game for a long time but the game doesn't reward you for it. The characters that you built for a long time gets powercrept.

"Loved the game since launch, but something a lot of players will begin to notice once they hit the late game is the out with the old and in with the new.

My luck in Genshin is okay – I’ve won a few 50/50 pulls in a row there – but in HSR, I’ve only won once and then kept losing the 50/50. Don't claim there's a 50/50 chance if it doesn't feel like it.

"amazing story, amazing design either on characters or the world itself, but the biggest problem is the enemies HP inflation and how they keep releasing new broken dps! let me use my old characters and not just keeping up with the update.",4,2025-02-26 17:59:38
Hey i like it,5,2025-02-26 17:47:33
GAME VERY VERY FUN AND INTERESTING but u need to be very chill since sometimes the boss is so hard to fight🗿,5,2025-02-26 17:32:03
"Everything is fine, it would have been a 5-star rating, but there's just one problem, the ""STORAGE"". The storage of HSR is too large, even if you delete past quests, it's still big. It's just unfortunate for low and mid devices, I hope you can fix that and reduce your storage, that's all.",1,2025-02-26 17:26:42
Well at first I don't know the game and it happens I got a cute little character named herta and thats it kuru-kuru I'm in love on this game so far so good the gacha is fine though and farming is easy 🙏🏻❤️,5,2025-02-26 17:23:37

"The game has its own difficulty curve and the story it features is fabulous! Keep up the work! Edit: It had ,now no more ,the power creep is way too much the only thing making me play this is the story .",2,2025-02-26 17:14:57
Game is inconsistent with their writing and the focus on what type of audience they want to please. Also has a lot of censorship,1,2025-02-26 17:11:20
Nice,5,2025-02-26 17:02:15
"I love the game especially the combat system. I hate it at first because I was like press buttons randomly like I did with Genshin Impact but as I kept on playing, everything seems to be going well and building characters is just so easy and the combat system which is automated, I just love it. Story is great 8/10, character design - great 9/10. Overall, the game itself is great. Idc what other player says, this is just my own opinion. Been playing since release. Keep up the good work Hoyoverse.",5,2025-02-26 17:00:07
"Well, looks like I have to lower the rating a bit since my last review... The game does have issues that are becoming more and more visible with every new patch, mostly powercreep issues, either in characters or lightcones. While it is true HSR gives more currency to players, the players are expected to pull for both characters and weapons to be able to comfortably clear the latest end game modes. We lack f2p options and actually viable 4 stars (I can count the useable 4 stars on one hand).",4,2025-02-26 16:41:10

"too many takes time to play this game, especially in clearing event. no skip button, boring storytelling, plain exploration and too much RNG (character gacha, weapon gacha, mainstat, substat, relic conversion, turn base battle). think is the game just for passionate people who learning deeply for good in game. not casual player who have little times for play the game. ✌️",1,2025-02-26 15:49:55

Great start but gradually went downhill after Penacony the game's story writing and Character balancing went into the gutter and it got EVEN WORSE on 3.0 patch not worth playing this game anymore,1,2025-02-26 15:42:24

"Good going so far, but 3.1 is boring. Mydei is uninteresting as a character. I also hate Anaxa. Can't wait for 3.2.",3,2025-02-26 14:38:39
"The fundamental of this game is inehrently flawed, there are no room for skill expression, the way to beat the game is getting better unit + good relics. Nihility is already gimped with EHR requirement while Harmony can just buff their allies right away with no such thing. Focusing on a single character is just waste of time because they will get powercrept few months later, and new char will use a new relic and planar set so you can't transfer your previous relic. Don't bother to play this game",1,2025-02-26 14:38:13

"This game has a lot of powercreep. If you have tons of money and ready to drop those into the game patch after patch than this game is for you. This game is not free to play friendly, story gets really really bad. Play if you can pay",1,2025-02-26 14:07:27

"It's really fun been playing since release and boooy is the dev team generous, currently one of my favourites if not the favourite game I have on my phone. Also I would like to add that usually I don't have any difficulty clearing most content and everything has been really fun, some people complain you need to buy $100 packs every month or spend alot but I only buy express pass once a month and I still have lots of jades and my characters are all e0 sometimes s1 and can clear without issues",5,2025-02-26 11:50:07

"I have actually played this game since its release and im surprised i haven't rated it yet. I'd like to say that the storyline, characters, everything is so amazing. Plus, I'd also like to request that it would be helpful to add a Trailblaze level decrease feature which could reduce your trailblaze lvl along with the enemies' strengths,,, i have been long at the max trailblaze lvl and still struggle with enemies. So it would be really helpful to add this feature",5,2025-02-26 11:13:59

"Terrible powercreep just like it's predecessor, even genshin meta doesn't shift this fast. This game gives out 10 free pull each patch as a way to tell you ""hey pull for this new character (which will be useless in 5 patch) otherwise you'll struggle in endgame content lol"". But If you're a casual player then it's not that bad I guess🤷🏻‍♀️",2,2025-02-26 11:01:33

"I've been playing this game since release, and it's so much better than Genshin. There's no pressure to explore or constantly grind for stellar jades. The character models look incredible, and the animations only get better. Progression is very easy as long as you know who to pull for. To any newbies out there, it gets a lot easier once you play for a while! I've never had problems where I didn't have enough pulls to get a character. Freaking 9/10 game.",5,2025-02-26 10:38:16

"It's good, but in 1.6 I realized if you want easy and get everything in event, you have to pay. It's a pay to win game, without specific 5 stars character your battle will be more difficult Update: it's 3.1 and I haven't change my mind.

This game reminds me a lot of RPG games especially JRPG ones. I love how immersed the story is and some of the gameplays (in the story or mini games from event) made me nostalgic about some RPG games I have played before.

It's been a fun journey. My time ends here as I can't say I like the direction the game and the company wants to take their products going forward. Here's to hoping it doesn't end up as Blizzard 2.0.,1,2025-02-26 09:56:04

"I don't like how this game is going. How they sell the characters, how the old unit is so useless unless you invest on their support. How the elemental and roles-rule doesn't seem to have any use with characters like anaxa, acheron, firefly, robin which completely neglects their role + elemental implant. The predatorial marketing needs to be stop, and powercreep needs to be addressed.",1,2025-02-26 08:21:15

You guys are trying to get the players to buy her so they can beat the battles faster, and I would want a challenge, not an easy game. No one is happy about this, so I suggest either removing the character or removing the part where she can revive characters even though she's not in the team. This just makes the game extremely unfair, and you will lose players.",1,2025-02-26 07:11:01
"The ratio of character releasing and the premium currency is super unbalanced you sometimes can't even guarantee a character per patch unless you pay, also the powercreep in the game makes a 4 month old character feel weak and flawed so fast because of the fast release of overpowered characters constantly, story is dull and full of just talking with little action.",1,2025-02-26 07:09:37

"Used to really enjoy the game but the developers have made it clear they are phoning it in at this point end game content is becoming artificially difficult through hp inflation, my favourite characters that I worked hard to get and build have become irrelevant and weak to newer characters that in my opinion have less interesting designs and kits. It's becoming stale and boring for me. Hopefully the Devs can fix thier mistakes and turn it around but it's not looking good, my interest is fading.",1,2025-02-26 06:56:11

"Better than genshin, less grind heavy and time consuming but its not open world, many units became useless without a e2 and they keep making powerful-er character so you have to keep pulling for new units. Going on the same money hungry road of genshin, the reward got WAY less generous since launch, the design got less creative and the color palettes are pretty repetitive. The story isn't very good.

"Update: Game is getting stale. You have 3 end game modes other than grinding. Inherently, turn based games are low skilled and combining that with powercreep makes early characters practically useless. Every new char is always better than the old and can directly replace old chars in teams. The number of chars and access to these chars make it impossible to do any actual strategy. It is fun sometimes, but it's to the point I am thinking about quitting. Story is great, but I can watch yt for that",2,2025-02-26 05:26:10
"Don't download this game, the devs are way too greedy, they want to add characters that add account wide buffs, such as a teamwide revive for the upcoming anniversarry character. Waste of time and resources. The gameplay is fun at a base level, but it has been streamlined to doing everything on auto with no thought being put in at all. Examples of this, are firefly teams, where you literally turn off your brain & spam all your buttons for easy end game clear. The story is not worth the bother",1,2025-02-26 05:24:08

"Horrible experience for free to play player. You can't clear the content without pulling for the newest characters and they don't give up enough pulls to do so.

Legit trash as the game goes on. End game content is super reliant on pulling for newest banner character and building characters is a huge chore with the upgrade RNG actively working against you at every turn.

Can't say I'm having the best time rn: There are far too many units that you need to clear newer content. At this point you need to get both new characters in a patch for every patch. The rewards that you get just can't get you there. That is not to mention the lack of skip button and too much text. Farming also takes a decent amount of time and resources.

There's like 5-6 different reasons why this game is turning into a mess but I'll stick to the universal problems. I know it is a gacha but the way they are shilling new characters and phasing out the old ones is a big indicator of their predatory behaviour. New events give very few rewards compared to the beginning of the game. Endgame content suffers from artificial difficulty with enemies becoming bigger hp sponges with each patch.

"It is not a pay-to-win game. It is a pay-to-play game. Old characters are totally useless for the current version, while new characters are also useless if they are not at least c1.

The battle pass and the express supply pass are not enough. $100 packs are necessary each month.

Every character you get will always get powercrept so there is no actual point in even getting new characters cuz they will 100% be powercrept. The bosses now have to much hp making it impossible.

Tired of unending bad luck and lack of protection from it. Lost all but one 50/50 since patch 2.0 and every time it went to pity 76-80. I refuse to spend months to farm 150+ pulls for a single character every damn time. I'm almost convinced that devs hate me for something and in some blacklist to have the worst RNG possible every time. And the powercreep of the game is too much to rely on older characters. Half of the are borderlime unplayable now.,2,2025-02-18 14:35:36

I've been playing it for 3 months now....i just have some problems with the Aventurine shield wearing off on every 1 or 2 turns and the Sunday ultimate being all wonky sonetimes....i suggest you fix both of these bcs this bug been going on for months now. And fix your pulling system to treat players more fairly in getting the 5-star units they wish,3,2025-02-13 07:52:43

"How can this be, that a game such as this, clearly designed to be played on gamepad, doesn't recognize majority of devices? I have older Xbox controller, connected via USB-C, it is seen by OS, seen by any other games that support controllers, even smaller, free indie productions, but it's not seen by game with a big budget such as this? Something ain't right here. Perhaps the game itself is good, but I won't know, because touchscreen is not the way to play a game like this. Disappointing.",2,2025-02-13 05:54:13

You deserve to play a better game than this.,1,2025-02-13 03:11:34
I love this game however lately it's been missing voice acting in English dub which can be a tad frustrating. 2.7 and 3.0 updates have some muted. Waiting to progress the story until they're patched in,3,2025-02-13 01:44:45
"Game has slowly but surely drove away female and normal players to be replaced by waifu lovers. Congrats I guess , but FYI most waifu collectors don't play games for prolonged periods. The new cow character is just plain disgusting and doesn't fit any part of the game. They need to fire the new art team and bring back the old one",1,2025-02-12 23:13:57

I feel like this game kinda caters to everyone. If you don't like futuristic themes there's a planet that isn't as futuristic and if you like traditional themes then that's for you. There's also a wide range of fun and vibrant characters with fun interesting personalities and backstories. The story ngl is also really good but sometimes falls flat but don't let that make you delete the game because they definitely redeemed themselves on the lore in the newest update.

"I'm so tired of the insufferable amount of unskippable dialogue in this game. And I'm not even talking about 3.0, I was going through my backlog of pending missions and it is just the worst experience I ever had. Even visual novels let you skip or fast forward dialogue.",1,2025-02-11 23:16:30

"I have started playing since launch and one thing is certain - the character design and environment design is absolutely great, no doubt. And there are cool characters yet to come as well. But the storytelling is a bit too dry for one to enjoy the storyline and actually understand it. Hopefully there will be some changes in 3.1. Additionally, a lot of older characters barely fit into today's meta now and it sucks pulling for the newest character each patch because only they can clear endgame.",3,2025-02-11 21:24:42

"This game is so amazing! Warning: You'll be addicted lmao. I stayed here because of the music and the worlds. The character designs here are so complicated, and it's not bad, but it's so good! Love the comedy here. The trailblazer is so goofy 😅 I sometimes don't understand the lore, but I think it's good. I love the gameplay, and you sometimes need a strategy to win the boss fights. Love it, but it can waste your time if you don't manage your time wisely. Overall 10/10 game. Really recommended.",5,2025-02-11 15:56:02

"The Galaxy is great, story great for the most part. I loved bellabog and it's story, however the story was so well done other planets can feel lack luster (Not a huge problem tbh). The only thing is the current dreamscape world has really lost me for a game heavily story oriented having what I'd consider unattractive story makes it hard to look past annoying mechanics ment to make the game harder. Still a great game.",4,2025-02-11 08:13:46
"The powercreep for this game is painfully obvious and makes me not want to play it for a long time. Old characters like Jingliu barely have any damage anymore. Also, with the recent characters needing a lot more luxury pulls (i.e. needing copies of a character or signature weapon reliance) it feels like hsr is becoming more and more greedy like genshin. As soon as Endfield drops, I'll be transferring to that game easily.",2,2025-02-11 05:38:07

"Game has drastically dropped in quality over the last year, with minimal effort by devs. Latest patch which was the new version update is one of the worst ones yet. Basically no cutscenes, voice acting missing, black screens instead of having their models move, is embarrassing how lackluster it is. On top of that latest character requires either 2 limited 5* teammates or to pull duplicates of her to function. Such a massive drop in quality from when I did my review for version one",2,2025-02-10 01:32:12

But the Amphoreus story is kind of bland, but knowing we're still in the prologue of Amphoreus, so it means that they have something for us in future patches. Also, I found someone say that it sucks when they make a new account, there's no skip button. It's because they will think you're a new player, I feel like it's easy why there's no skip button on alt accounts.",4,2025-02-09 08:34:12

I hope the game adds new and refreshing ideas or mechanics.",2,2025-02-09 02:33:04

This game has a hint of humor along with a great story. All characters look majestic. Genshin could never. The battlefield mechanics can also be sped up or you can auto battle if you don't like the turn based battle. All of the characters have interesting lore which drew me in. I started when it first launched and then fell in love.,5,2025-02-08 20:38:48

"The game has become complacent with its quality and is increasingly power-creeping previous characters with each new release. Stealth-buffing enemy HP every patch to force people to pull on new banners or get new eidolons is disgusting considering how rare and expensive it is to aquire premium currency. The greed of this company knows no bounds, and with a heavy heart, I must dissuade others from rewarding such practices.",1,2025-02-08 18:19:16

Story telling is both fun and modern-trend, not my cup of tea but it really works like magic. Some world is more beautiful than the other one, in both lore and aesthetics.

Guys WHAT is going on with your lazy animations and lazy storytelling? Why has the game declined when genshin and others are improving in their animations? Hours and hours of story with just a black screen and white text. You'd think the game doesn't make any money but that's absolutely not true. You need to put more effort in. Do your jobs. Basic animations and storytelling shouldn't be rare.,1,2025-02-07 05:48:25

"Great game, great characters and all but playing this game on a daily basis can become a chore and if you miss out, you can't pull the new and shiny characters without paying money. It sucks and the price of these so called packs are so damn costly. An avg person can't afford these types of games on a daily basis. Plus spending lots of money on a virtual character when you can spend that amount on a whole new AAA game is just insane. I can't recommend this game for new players.",3,2025-02-06 14:01:06

"Picked it up on the second phase of 1.2, and the latest 3.0 update sucks. Bloated pretentious dialog, pathetic story telling, charater models during main quest is done lazily, not to mention the absurb powercreep every patch. This game has no reason to be this lazy with the hundreds of millions it receives. Also because brain dead fans defending it, which makes the game worse.

"I don't know why in the past few months playing HSR has sometimes felt annoying, not just in the gacha system. but in the nerf character system, the characters in the story are OP and when we build them first they are very OP. So I really feel down, I feel like I'm being forced to continue following the meta character. and whether gacha pull 1x or Bulk 10x, the rate is really different. In the past, pulling once still had a chance of getting B5, but now it's impossible. I have to pull 70/90",1,2025-02-05 20:59:49

"The game is actually very fun to play from the stories and sidequests, but once you get into the endgame, its kind of hard to get comfortable in it since you most likely need some ""meta"" characters that would most likely be powercrept. And speaking of powercreep, it seems this game has a major issue with it due to them making endgame comfortable when you have max stat characters or the new premium characters because the endgame content mostly gives buffs to the characters being promoted.",4,2025-02-04 20:39:28

"I thought it'd be like any other Gacha games that has the lowest chances of getting a single good character but I love how this game proved me wrong, It has tons of generous rewards and even the light cone banner isnt a 50/50 chance and instead is actually a 25/75! Which actually encouraged me to pull more for lightcones for my favourite characters! Overall this game is amazing on letting newbies get a limited 5 star early from all the generous rewards!

Absurd power creep while summon rate is extremely low. HP inflation and mechanics that heavily favor only new meta units in end game contents. Old units become less relevant very quickly.

My only problem with this game is the relic and ornament grinding. It usually gives you 2 to 3 five star relic/ornament at the highest difficulty but most of it are useless ones because of its main stat and substat. I mean like why does it always give me bad ones? Not even a single one? The rewards are doubled and I grinding for like 12 times for the planar ornaments only to keep getting the same useless stats like break/def even though it's not suitable for the specific relic/ornament I want.,4,2025-01-28 05:00:44

"Graphics, soundtracks, optimization for low end, great character designs and the story, this game got it all, but the only problem is powercreep. One character comes out and they become unusable in end game content by the time they get a rerun.

"Updated review from day one player. I originally gave this 5 stars. Unfortunately after a year and a half later it has gone down a couple of notches. One is the inherit power creep of new units, which come every update. Older units that were invested in, both in time and resources have now been useless in the games current version. Another large issue is the degradation of the story, it's characters and environments, specifically in 3.0. It's really unfortunate.",3,2025-01-26 13:15:36

Giving this game a two stars because of what it has become low quality story presentation little to no effort at all. For the most part this game is a bit better than genshin in terms of awards and endgame but after playing while it seems like the storytelling quality is of the game is slowly being put in the shadow with greedy developers as the game earns more popularity.

"Serious HP inflation to deter casual players, myself included, from attempting endgame content.

"I used to love playing this game but they're now releasing fewer male characters while continuing to release fanservice female characters. The male units also have less impactful kits in the meta because a certain incel community will rage quit if a digital man is stronger than their waifu. Don't play this game if objectification of women will bother you or if you want equal fanservice. Also, powercreep is rampant and releases braindead units that require no strategy.",1,2025-01-21 20:35:08

For starters, I'd like to add that I do have ADHD so that may be a reason for my feelings but the story is rather boring and with no skip option, it feels repetitive.

"This review is on 3.0 ver The more I play the more flaws show up. The devs are extremly lazy. The game is a slideshow at this point. Characters barely animate and black screens with text describing movement like "" characters put their heads to eachother"" are very shameful for Hoyo. Camera work in ""Cutscenes"" is non existent and the characters talk extensively without any substance to their speech. The game MASSIVELY needs SKIP and Summarise button. It is honestly a chore to play the story.",2,2025-01-20 19:53:58

"First of all, Hsr is an amazing game to pass time. It has great graphics, easy gameplay and great character designs. Especially their combat animations. Although there's a lot of cons as well. One, there's no skip button. Players should be capable of skipping the story dialogue. Especially the ones who reroll or make new accs(Like me.) Two, the security verification code takes too long for me to receive through my email. I can't play my old acc because of this. 1 star until this gets fixed.",1,2025-01-20 16:09:53

"Played since day 1 release. Currently on 3.0 The game has got its ups and downs. When it's up, it's really great. When it's bad, it's mind numbing and boring and timewasting. I don't think there is any comparable games on the market.",2,2025-01-20 13:47:40
"I love Amphoreus quest! I like how long it was since I was rly hyped for Amphoreus so I can interact with the characters I like longer (Castorice, phainon, mydei, aglaea... yea I kinda like most of the characters). I think hoyo can also make the quest shorter by dividing them into smaller parts and release them each patch but they decided not to, which I support them not dividing them to smaller parts like what happened to penacony. Penacony story felt so forced while Amphoreus doesn't.",5,2025-01-20 12:27:15
"Rating two because gacha wise this is one of the most soul crushing experiences I've had. A F2p nightmare. I want to cry. Cut scenes progressing through the game or while ""grinding"" for gems are un-skippable making it take an ungodly amount of time to save up for one multi(at least 4-5 hours if hyper focused), then the rates are so bad It makes all that feel for nothing.

Quality of the narrative has been dwindling and now it's no better than death-by-powerpoint. The only redeeming quality is the gameplay but the meta is constantly changing because of power creep making it difficult if neigh impossible for a free to play player to keep up.

"I think the bad aspects of the game has finally revealed. I can't stress enough on the mechanics of the game but one thing for sure, when a new character comes in, the previous character before feels like it's going to be powercrept soon.

The whole requirement of ""equilibrium levels"" is idiotic and probably just a method to force players to ""immerse"" themselves in a world when 9 times outta 10, they just rush over the story to continue the main story. The relics and light cones are just a headache. They follow the same system as virtually all Hoyo games, but still doesn't mean it's good.

I'm not a Genshin fan and never in my life wanted to play such games but after reconsidering giving this one a try I totally fell in love with it and changed my view this game is the reason I like hoyoverse and totally fell in love with their games honaki and zenless are m'y favourites but I slightly like honkai more since the story itself is just so perfect,5,2025-01-19 02:27:56

"This game can provide a pretty cool perspective on turn based combat with interesting mechanics. But it a can, not a guaranteed. To experience the game to its fullest you need a lot of luck. Its a gacha game. There's Luck in getting the characters you want, luck in getting the weapons, and luck in building the characters. And it's not just luck, the amount of resources they give you is quite low. And not to mention the amount of characters they shove out and the powercreep. It's annoying.",3,2025-01-17 12:23:34
"They tried to sell the story but they peaked too early and the story is now muddled in expositions n jargons. World building gets too much in the way of the main story instead of letting us players learn about it during gameplay. Spending too much time on learning about the bigger picture the delivery of the excellent main idea is going to fall flat. Just my opinion. Gameplay was fun at first. Repetitive design.

"Patch 3.0 is very bad. Just penacony with a new skin. bait in the first 30 minutes looks like the game has improved. Stop making yapping simulator with recycle puzzle system(recycle of clocky, origami bird, Puzzle to open the way, etc)",1,2025-01-16 14:22:39
3.0 is really disappointing. It reminds me of honkai impact 3 and I will not be surprised if everything in the new place turns out to be somewhat copy of that old gold story.Tbh after months of lacking of content this masterpiece of yapping around is really below average. And the power creep & group lock is a real thing here.,3,2025-01-16 13:31:29

"How they implemented the newer characters to the system are by powercreeping and inflate the hp of the enemies instead of reworking them into the system, causing the older units to be powercreeped when the new meta and/or patch comes in. There are no skip button while mimicking the playstyle of a visual novel but 3D. The writing are bloated with too much exposition and lengthy paragraph that should've been summarized shorter but not, causing the dialogues to sound pretentious.",1,2025-01-16 11:26:08

In the latest story patch 1/3 of the main cast is unvoiced in the English Dub. This is a major story patch and missing the character voices has significantly reduced the quality of the story imo.

The English dub voices for Dan Heng the Trailblazer and Hemiko are still mute. Some of the English and Japanese translations have huge mistakes in them. Especially the story of Dan Heng and Blade. And Jiaoqiu and Feixio. Because of that some people think they are lovers. They are not!!! Some characters like Adventurine are bugged. His skill doesn't work anymore.,2,2025-01-15 23:30:48
"Brilliant. Top-tier mobile game. Great characters, tons of interesting lore and an engaging plot with a unique set of styles and some funny Easter eggs, satisfying gameplay and animations too. Also, it is great for free-to-play players like myself as they give out all the resources you need to built top-level teams for free unlike in Genshin. Having fully built teams with all of the best characters with some of their signature weapons is a rarity for FTP players in any other game.",5,2025-01-15 23:19:37

I would not mind this as long as new content does not require you to pull new character to perform at least decently.

Penacony was amazing. Don't let any bad reviews make it seem otherwise because the story and characters (My wife Firefly in particular) all have amazing back stories and really fun kits to use.

fun but boring at the same time. it feels like a chore to farm for newer characters due to all the old ones being out of meta now (i stopped playing for around half a year.. seele is now f tier) and without any of the new characters it gets hard to basically clear anything like moc with full stars. this game's powercreep is disgusting and you should either nerf the new chars or buff the old ones because i can't even enjoy the story anymore cause i can barely clear boss fights TT,2,2025-01-15 12:35:21

Characters designs & graphics are magnificent but the story keeps on deteriorating. With the latest updates it just seems that the story that is being released just revolves around the character that needs marketing rather than having the character be integrated into the story. World building was already bad but recent updates just made the story unbearable to read through. If you want a brain rot kind of game then you might enjoy it with the superb graphics but it has nothing else to offer.,2,2025-01-15 10:16:42

"I love this game so much, the characters, the chill gameplay, etc. However, I couldn't rate it 5 stars, because I've played so many gacha games before, and I know that powercreep is normal, but they do it way too fast in HSR. Like I invest in a character and suddenly in 2-3 patches, they're kinda mid. Of course, I ike seeing my favorite characters do big damage too, and of course, powercreep is normal, but it's way too fast in HSR and I feel pressured to pull for characters that I don't like.",3,2025-01-15 08:17:57

"Aventurine is a top-tier sustain, yet he was bugged for an entire patch, and there's no compensation for it? The bug appeared right after his rerun banner, which felt like we got scammed. It’s unfair that this specific issue didn’t warrant separate compensation beyond the usual 300 Stellar Jades we get every month. We spent 44 days relying on a broken sustain who couldn’t even protect allies properly, leading to actual defeats in combat—and we get nothing in return?",1,2025-01-15 07:53:39

The longer the game is out the slower the story makes any meaningful progression (the last new planet was released 10 months ago in February) and the more obnoxiously difficult all end game content becomes unless you sink a fortune into the newest characters, even if your only slightly older characters are well built with solid teams.

I had left a previous review addressing the storage issues which made me worry that I couldn't continue the game anymore. But I'm so glad the devs took us mobile players into account and cleared the issue. I've been anticipating Amphoreus as I love Greek Mythology and I'm so glad I can now experience it.,5,2025-01-14 09:00:39

"Bad story overall, mediocre storytelling if not complete abysmal. Visuals are decent, nothing outstanding but its a positive.

"Old units got powercreep so easily, they need buff. Not by adding new harmony characters to buff them (like jingyuan), they really have to buff those old units. Team synergies are too specific, you can't play your favorite characters without needing a certain other character that might not be to your liking (like feixiao). HP inflation is crazy, older units had a hard time to fight them. I won't be surprised if one day they are going to make a x99 HP bar like in HI3rd at this point...",1,2025-01-13 23:30:10

After a decent start they turned the MC into a worthless cameraman. It is boring to play a story focused videogame as a character who does not participate in that story. Last 3 patches were especially egregious in that regard. I do not recommend playing this game anymore.,1,2025-01-13 06:16:33

"This is such a fun game tbh. In my opinion, it's better than the other games they made. recommend!",5,2025-01-10 03:12:16
This game is amazing. Beautiful everything. Brilliant writing. Challenging combat. So much to run around and do. Very F2P friendly. Anyone saying characters get rendered useless... no. Just no. I will say that you have to put real thought into which gear to use with which units to use with which other units. Anyone saying that the story makes no sense just can't admit that it's too complicated for them to understand. Not trying to put anyone down or assert superiority. Just saying.,5,2025-01-10 03:06:52

"My review disappeared, first of all I will say the characters are designed beautifully. My favourite is Jing Yuan, sadly apart from the Loufu and Balabog I didn't enjoy the dreamscape storyline much due to the overpowered battles. The game needs more difficulty options added, an easy casual mode that is actually just that. The one in game certainly is not casual, I got thrashed by enemies 15 levels lower than me. This is disgraceful, it needs better balance.",1,2025-01-10 02:17:58

"I play this game daily! Not only is it very rewarding, it is free to play and allows anyone to have fun with little to zero pay. There's a lot of endgame content and the storyline is very smooth and fun to read, the play style is extremely entertaining and I enjoy the fact that there is a casual setting for when you aren't able to beat an enemy that is too strong. It has very alluring characters, plus it allows you to make any character strong with the right attention. Very fun and enjoyable! :3",5,2025-01-09 23:16:37

Too much yapping and stationary storytelling. Id rather read a visual novel. And goodness that abysmal banana patch. Powercreep is too fast while the gameplay is just character and stat check. Not really enough strategy for a turned based game while the spd stat gated wth rng along with crit stats with the horrible relic system. Too many characters so little pulls per patch with a 50 50 and no guarantee lightcone banner which is just a picture with stats lol,1,2025-01-09 08:33:28

"The game is good, but it lacks one final touch to make it not only good, but outstanding. Is a skip button the reason? What is the purpose of lore archives if not everyone is ready to waste their time reading a long discourse full of boring nonsense? Then as a decoration? If the player really needs to learn the game's story, they can simply read it on internet portals or in the archives rather than wasting time reading dialogues that have nothing to do with the primary mission.",1,2025-01-08 08:27:49

"Insane power creep in this game, if you want to clear content at high level you must always pull for the newest premium characters, and even if you end up pulling them they won't last ""powerful"" for too long before they implement another busted unit.

"This game runs great on my phone! (I have a Motorola G stylus 5G with 8gb + 4 ram boost, so 12gb of RAM in total. And with 256gb of storage with Genshin, Zenless and Wuthering. And still have plenty of storage) Also it's fun, in my opinion. Id say if people have problems with lag or something along those lines, it's usually their device that's the problem because my phone was less than $300 lol.

The game is greedy and can't make good banners. How come a character can stay for more than a year without a rerun but another character gets a rerun after two patches of release???

Recently got back to playing the game and when I logged in to my old account all of my progress was gone.

Hopefully this will be fixed if I try to reinstall the app because I have dedicated a very generous portion of my time into this game.,1,2025-01-02 03:38:24

"The game is great. Awesome visuals and characters. The game play is easy enough to pick up. You do have to like/love RPGs and the grinding and farming it takes to level up your characters. But the bosses are so tough, and for the most part, you have to be lucky to beat those bosses. If you think it's a pay-to-play game. Yes, and no, you can still play and progress in the game. You just need a little bit of luck (mostly).",4,2025-01-02 01:13:41

didn't expect to like a turn based game this much. there's still strategy involved unless u whale then every content becomes braindead auto-able. not full 5 stars from me because some characters are just weak and unusable in the meta. and sometimes story in events are too long and draggy. but overall a fun game.,4,2024-12-31 16:17:53

"Hi, Hoyoverse Team! Honkai: Star Rail is amazing—graphics, strategy, and character designs are great! Jing Yuan is my favorite. Please add a skip button for story scenes to avoid repetitive dialogues and improve farming for Traces, as it’s tough compared to relics. A ""Memories"" feature to rewatch cutscenes, like Mother Cocolia’s story, would also be awesome. The story is incredible, but these features would enhance gameplay.

Graphics are fine (pending on your phone's capabilities). It's nice to customize the graphics to suit your needs, and in a recent update, also be able to delete unneeded data from past missions/quests to save space on your phone.

Not to mention if you're a male character enjoyer, your DPS choices are basically confined to 2 out of 6 elements.

totally love this game but pls don't change meta every update like I was on hiatus on sparkle release and i got her and was really happy cuz she's the best support at that time. and then when i came back she fell off really hard and now it's all about break. Plus can we make all calyx or relics domain accessible because i just got rappa recently and it's locked out from quests which i don't have really any time to complete;),5,2024-12-27 22:49:58

"Wonderful game with good story that only gets better each time. However, the grinding is just too much. So many things needed to upgrade and very easy to spend in-game correct which adds on another thing to farm for. Also, the powercreep is crazy! For every few patches (update) there's a new character that would immediately powercreep the older characters that only got released for a few patches ago. Makes the story impossible to progress with OG characters unlike Genshin. But they are generous!",3,2024-12-27 22:24:18

"I have play more than one year. Let me share the reasons to not play this game: 1. Bad gacha/pulling rate, at worst case scenario, you need 280 pulls to guarantee an character and his/her signature weapon. 2. Some game mechanics is lock behind limited characters, for example: Topaz, Acheron. 3. Tedious RNGs on gear progression. 4. Serious powercreep and hp inflation problems. 5. No skip button/function for story. 6. Abysmal map design and puzzle. 7. Bad optimization on low end phone.",1,2024-12-26 20:03:23

"A really good premise damaged by the MiHoyo treatment. The gacha is way too stingy, and you get hardly any free pulls to tide you over. A good gacha should support true f2p, not just f2p with occasional splurges, which is what most people end up getting baited into being with a system as stingy as this. It also has other classic abusive tactics like a relic system where no relic is ever truly perfect, encouraging permagrind. The story is amazing and the combat is great! But it isn't worth this.",3,2024-12-20 05:05:08
"I just started. Downloaded the beginning with an hour wait, then I play and suddenly I have to wait another hour because what I just downloaded was a starter.

I tried again many times and I can't even open it anymore. It's just black after the loading screen even after 20mins.",1,2024-12-20 04:28:53

Enjoyed the game. Love the aesthetics. The gatcha rates are horrible but enjoyed the gameplay so i didnt mind to continue playing it to pass the time. Still hesitant to create an alt account because of the unskippable cutscenes. Major cutscenes are fine abd tolerable but the side quest cutscenes are just atrocious. Walls of text that have no bearing and are a waste of time. I wont be spending money on it until its more user friendly to create alt accounts. Pls add skip function to the story.,3,2024-12-18 04:51:23

This game is a masterpiece! Do you want to play boring endgame content every 6 weeks for 25 mins tops? Do you want to farm for a new character(that costs way too much) for years in a tedious and frustrating way every day only to have them be power crept after 4-5 months? Do you like playing 2-3 events tops in each update where you can't even use your characters? Do you enjoy boring and endless amount of dialogue in both main story and events without the option to skip? Then play this trash!,1,2024-12-17 22:53:56

The characters are well designed, they dont completely sexualize women (theres no/barely and jiggle physics), it's more like they want the characters to look magnificent. The story is well thought thru and the combat is pretty fun, even if it's turn-based. It means they can focus alot on the individual animations of characters.

"Incredible story, good character design (both with personality/backstory and design), good combat. Perhaps powercreep hits way too hard (don't listen to the ones that ssy otherwise) since dps units from one year ago are basically useless. But star rail has won my heart for many reasons. The excitement towards a new patch or a new character are priceless.

"Attention needs to be brought to the ridiculous increase in enemy hp going on with enemies. It's coming to a point where you need meta teams or the newest meta units to beat things like endgame content. If this keeps up, eventually those previously meta units will become obsolete, just like the ones before them, so you'll constantly need to pull for new units (which are 95% 5 Star units, so you can't even guarantee pulls really) to replace the old ones over and over and over.

i hope you'll release a five star male character that isn't imaginary or physical. Also the power creeping in this game is atrocious there's really no point in pulling for rerun characters since they'll get power creep by new characters and also the hp inflation is bad.

I adore the turn based playstyle and auto battle you can put on if your doing homework off to the side or something and need materials. I would recommend this game to friends and people I did not know. I love the characters and their designs (especially Jing Yuan) and would love to see the new characters coming out. 10/10 game with good graphics and story,5,2024-12-11 00:03:40
I really love this game and yes I'm been supporting Hoyoverse for more than a year now and the developer never let me down with these amazing games! 5 star no offense,5,2024-12-10 21:25:22
"Amazing game, great variety of characters with unique designs and personalities. Great storyline although qeust do take a while it keeps the game interesting. Amazing graphics and doesn't take up all my storage on mobile ☆",5,2024-12-10 19:29:33
"Came for the turn-based combat style, stayed for the story. The writing and the way the story is implemented is perfection. The cutscenes, the switching POVs, the plot twists, the characters...etc. feels like watching a show in a way. Top-tier. So much fun!",5,2024-12-10 14:13:21
A really great and nice game with alot of fun things to do i love it definitely worth playing,5,2024-12-10 13:29:55

"Was fun at first, but with the consistent power creep i dont think i can keep up with the game at this rate. The devs try to spice up the gameplay by introducing characters doing big damage regardless of their roles, it starts to feel like the only way forward is to consistently power creep. This is slowly becoming those generic cash grab gacha games. Tho i have to admit the story is nice and animations are great.",3,2024-12-10 10:11:56
Laggy and don't blame me that my phone even in new version still cheap. Just a player wanted to play. Your advertisement are so cringe and you are also biased that you made characters so equally handsome which makes predatory in gachas and make a way for money.

"I've been playing this game since ver. 1.0 came out and personally, i love this game. The story is truly mesmerizing (Besides luofu imo it sucks)with every patch we get new story quest i feel even more satisfied with lore (coming from a person with lore obsession). The turn based combat is also good in my opinion, at least once you understand what's even going on. Ultimates or skill animations are also pretty. The exploration is not too hard, and rather chill and enjoyable for casual players.",5,2024-12-10 01:01:30
"Update. After getting pretty far into the game, the material farming becomes the worst thing ever. If I wasn't wasting my time waiting for my level 80 character to destroy 1 million ice bats for 30 minutes, I'd actually be able to play other game modes. I'll come back if they ever change this mind-numbing feature.",3,2024-12-10 00:44:27
"The game is very fun and has mazing designs and music, however unlike other hoyoverse games I played , power creep is very noticeable here which as a result makes you think twice before actually rolling the gacha. Overall a good game but needs an answer to power creep even if it like fgo's strenghtening quests that permanently buff a characters kit every now and then. Story needs to avoid stuff like the killing npcs to show the antagonist is serious part that the 2.5 version story I hated it",3,2024-12-10 00:40:58

"I retract most of my previous statements, this is a good game poorly managed. Lots of content, so much filler that it becomes a chore. My biggest gripe however is the balance, old 5 stars are obsolete by the time they rerun and it's worse than Genshin on that front. Play for the story then leave it alone, not worth spending money on characters that are only meta for three weeks during their banner.",2,2024-12-09 16:27:36

"this game is overall amazing, the story is entertaining, the characters are well written, the graphics are beautiful as well. although i think it may be hard to get characters, probably its just me being extremely unlucky. some of the bosses or enemies are such a hassle to defeat, dont get me wrong, i do based turn games, its just hard for me. i dont have a lot of built characters either. i just hope they would make more events and stories that are entertaining but also funny.",5,2024-12-09 10:41:13

This is big on story and has long pauses in the game play that are filled with storyline that you are forced to go through, you can not skip it. Some of special attacks are over the top and animation takes a long time. Once you've seen this a few times, the thrill is gone and it becomes annoying.

Ok I'm not sure what some people here are talking about but to summerize it Game definitely needs a skip button It is amazing And no it is not a casino the game is luck based with building your characters but even them the game gives you lots of in-game currency to pull if you spend money and get nothing that's just bad luck don't blame the game for your bad luck and call it a casino you paid on your own for the in-game currency no one forced you 💜,5,2024-12-08 14:55:28

"Great story, fun and entertaining characters, and really cool fight system. There's also a ton of optional in-game booklets and little lore bits which is also great. They also added a Finality's Vision feature which allows you to play events that coincide with quests you haven't done yet, which fixed my only issue in the game.",5,2024-12-06 16:41:23

"Game is great despite its huge size due to being open world, which most turn based game doesn't have. For those who preferred hsr to be action-combat like genshin, I'm strongly against that (this game has its own uniqueness). Complaints: make the story skippable, as it slows down the gameplay, bc some ppl (like me) prefers fast-paced quest clearance. As for limited gacha, 90 pulls guaranteed 5* chars isn't f2p friendly (esp for endgame contents), not to mention light cones are included too.",4,2024-12-06 15:01:00

"One day, after dinner, while my younger sister and I were lounging about in Mr. Gopher Wood’s yard, we spotted a fledgling Charmony Dove all on its own. That baby bird was tiny, it didn’t even have all of its feathers, and it couldn’t sing. When we found it, it was already on its last breath, having fallen into a shrub — probably abandoned by its parents. We decided to build a nest for it right there and then. However, thinking back, that winter was unusually cold, with fierce winds at night",5,2024-12-05 16:42:39

Overall, the quality is AAA jRPG caliber, but it's free (as long as you don't fall into the gacha gambling trap). For a gacha, the daily log-in ""chores"" can be done in 2 minutes without even paying attention, and power creep is incredibly slow. A+, amazing game.",5,2024-12-04 23:09:41

"Fun game that has a well written story and very interesting characters. Only thing preventing this from being 5-stars is how absurdly hard endgame content gets. Not everyone can afford to purchase the new characters, and I find it quite hard to easily clear endgame content with older characters, as I don't have a lot of the new characters. The game is still enjoyable, but if you want to make the most of it it's like you're incentivized to spend money and an absurd amount of time into it.",4,2024-12-04 08:30:27

"This game is so worth giving a shot. The storyline only gets better and better. The characters are insanely well written, and their design are chosen with so many details connecting to their lore. The gameplay is pretty fun with incredible visuals, and the events are always something new and fun to do! I like the balance between the seriousness and the silliness. The game feels more realistic due to the way the characters speak. I dont have any words left. (Sunday best written character ever)",5,2024-12-04 06:58:17

"This game is very good and I like it, the story, music, animations, and characters.. definitely should try it! Although the combat mechanism would seem a bit complicated at first you'll get used to it eventually. The animations is somewhat unique in the story mode, it may switch to 2D design with something animated. What I really like is the rewards and achievements, It can be F2P friendly if you're hardworking, And the permanent events! It's so fun for endgame, and they made it permanent:)",5,2024-12-04 06:12:52

"The game is fun, pretty characters, amazing graphics. I love the ultimate character animations, so beautiful! But I noticed 2 things. 1. There is a huge lack of male characters in a multi gender game. 2. The meta is extremely hard to keep up with and you constantly have to pull for new characters. If I use Blade right now and compare him to Acheron, Blade is unmatched compared to Acheron. The old characters are worthless now because of the meta and everything new being REALLY strong for no reaso",4,2024-12-04 05:21:49

Tired of the long dialogue and I do love this game. But I'm giving it a 1 star until they add a skip button. I value my time and I can understand some people play games like this for the story. I don't and want to continue playing but I'd rather be actually playing the game for hours instead of being stuck in dialogue for hours. Will change from my 1 star when a skip button feature is added.,1,2024-12-03 21:20:42

"I play HSR since its launch. Love the character designs and turn baaed gameplay, so far. Story wise it is okay and provide few cliffhangers to look forward. The major downfall however is the messy plots. I feel Hoyoverse try to squeeze in so many characters (which are irrelevant) to the story progression with tonzillion dialogues, making it super bloated and hard to follow. Isn't it time to introduce ""skip"" function with added plot summary to the story?",3,2024-12-03 09:16:36

"Out of the 3 games I played from this company, this one has the most diversity and the best male-female ratio in 5* characters so far. It's not 5-6 female banners back-to-back at least. The team behind this one knows they need to give both genders (and all the colors of the rainbow) what they want and keep everyone content. We'll see if they can keep to this mentality in the future. ZZZ was the first to fail, genshin slowly following behind it.",5,2024-12-03 06:44:13

"I Was Wrong! With all my previous experience with Hoyoverse games, I thought this game would be bad and just another awful mobile game. But when I heard it was turn based, I was surprised to say the least! I thought it was another open world exploration game that tried to be Dark Souls for kids! But with my love for turn based games, I HAD to try it! And let me tell you, out of every mobile game I've ever played, this is the only one I'd recommend to a colleague or friend! I hope everyone plays!",5,2024-12-02 01:07:53

I hope that co-op will be implemented in this game cause it's more fun to play with others rather than yourself. Also with co-op I can help my sister farm for relics and equipments necessary for her characters.,4,2024-12-01 21:00:16

"It's okay. I dont like turn based games though, I only installed this because of the story and characters, turn based is pretty boring for me, I prefer dodging, parrying, and counter attacking. Edit: Nvm I take back what I said abt it being ""okay"", I love it ehehhehehe. Gimme my free Yanqing already, I demand hoyo to make me lose every 50/50 to Yanqing.",5,2024-12-01 14:38:06
Nah blud i hate you now.,1,2024-12-01 12:17:10
"The game is solid. The story is like pizza when it's great, it's unbelievable, and when it's not, it's still pretty good. However, the biggest problem is progression. Farming takes a very long time (at least without spending money, I tend not to). Repetitive battles make the game feel dated. Additional options don't help if material can only be obtained by repetitive auto battles that you HAVE to watch. This broken element keeps me away from playing more of the game.",3,2024-12-01 11:58:03

"It used to be good but the story has turned into an insult to the players' intelligence - It's gibberish and endless too. I slogged through several patches hoping the writers would get a grip but no they just make it worse and worse. The game even encourages you to autobattle and then has no respect for your time. I'm out, best avoided.",2,2024-12-01 03:24:29

Güzel bir oyun. Ana karakterin hikayesi bence daha iyi olabilirdi. Onun dışında oyundaki öbür karakterlerin hikayeleri gerçekten çok iyi. Penacony gezegeninin hikayesi muhteşem.

The story is good but I'm have 3 issues so far where I pause to send a text and get back to the game and it restarts the story dialogue from the beginning of the scene. Issue 2 is loading where it fails to load from the start screen the train doesn't change camera angle so I have to close and reopen the game to start it. Issue 3 is I had a bug where I'm supposed to add someone to my team but can't as the screen froze so I had to close and reopen it to find it restarted to the very beginning,3,2024-11-28 14:11:10
"Super fun, immersible story that pulls you on a challenge,but if your a good gamer it's easy. Can be chill and relaxing game to do especially with the auto fight and doing the activitys and quest. 100% the pulls are the most nerve wracking, you have a guarantee 5 star pull but you may or may not get the Character. All characters are good your entire build matters most. If people say a character sucks it's only because 1 they don't know how to play and 2 their build sucks.

I have way too much to say about this game to the point that I couldn't even put it all here but if you like flashy turn based combat games and anime art styles as well as a beautifully built in depth world and amazing voice acting then this game is for you. I'm not a huge fan of gacha games but this is so much more than just a gacha game. Props to the voice actors and artists behind this game you truly made something wonderful and very enjoyable <333,5,2024-11-28 04:43:08
Great start to the game I really like the mechanics! It is Genshin Impact in space. I have noticed some minor rendering issues and big screens of pink spcae (team set up screen) or weapons being replaced by pink squares. Or enemies not rendering correctly (again pink squares!

I've been playing this game since it came out. It's a huge breath of fresh air from hoyo's other very popular game and actually relieves my burnout.

Peak! ABSOLUTE PEAK STORY! Peak Character designs and kit. And good exploration with unique areas. A very good and enjoyable combat system. Everything is so good about this game.,5,2024-11-26 01:37:43
"The game is ok, But the powercreep is disgusting. I Saved stellar jades and even bought a few only for my units that i like to play to get powercreep. No sense of balance, Every enemy units hp scaling in every patch is disgusting. 4star units are now irrelevant. Good job mihoyo, Buying things here are not worth it. It maybe good today but wait till 2-4 patches before your units get powercrept.",1,2024-11-26 01:23:34

loved the story although i hate turn based game... the plot and characters made me love this game!! the only thing that makes me bored in this game is constantly dying from enemies. i always die because the characters Ive always pulled are Nihility or Harmony path which makes me lack of defense and healing. overall its great!!! the only problem is enemies are too HARDDD TO DEFEAT!!! blablabla i wont complain anymore.,5,2024-11-25 20:53:17

"I do not know why people say this game is F2P while every character want their own signature Light Cone which is their 5* weapon basically, old characters get powercrept really fast by a huge margin, and many characters will either perform really bad without their dupes are kinda functions properly only after having some. Game has 50/50, events and story mode sometimes is hard to beat so you need new characters and end-game content is also new character performance exclusive.",1,2024-11-25 16:04:54
"It's a very fun game, it's not like Genshin but this game is probably almost better since it doesn't take 80 years to load and the NPCs don't attack you like Genshin, in this you can see the enemies so your alert, and this has auto fight, infinite stamina, cool techniques and the character designs are very cool including the characteristics and the backstories, although some people actually want some characters to have a happy backstory, but as a dan heng simp he is a ♾️/♾️, SO HANDSOMEE AGRHHHH",5,2024-11-25 15:46:41
"Pretty nice game though the combat gets boring rather quickly. I like the characters and the animations are sick, it's also nice that the gacha currency is easier obtainable than for Genshin. The names for some characters are lacking a bit though... ""Sunday"", ""Blade"" and ""Rappa"" (a rapper). At least the character designs aren't copy paste HI3 or GI.",4,2024-11-25 15:36:49

So far, Penacony has been my favorite world, since my favorite character (ehem ehem, Aventurine) is featured there. As a 1.0 player, it took me about 3 weeks to go from level 40 to 63. My character went from level 50 to 80 in just a short span of time. So far, I’m just waiting for Sparkle’s rerun because I badly need her for my Imbibitor Lunae",5,2024-11-23 05:49:31

"Love. It. Has many perks that make it better than Genshin (in my opinion), like early access to character level up and ascension materials. The rewards overall are much more generous than genshin, which makes me play it more. No complaints. Have it on a Vivo Asus MacBook, and it runs perfectly fine.

1. Endgame is becoming impossible. Doesn't matter if you whale or ftp. 2. Relics too randomized. Remove 5 layers of rng and put in a relic currency system. 3. Lack of variety. Expand beyond FUP and Break. Give love to DOT and add more types. 4. To many limited characters are being released. Allow old characters to rerun and more in one rerun. Also create more standard characters. 5. Screwllum is an npc. Actually knocking down a star just for that. 6. Not enough men. I like women but I like men,2,2024-11-22 00:23:02
"This is one of my favourite games of all time. I really like the characther's design and also the lore behind each characther. The story line was also amazing, especially in the penacony arc.

While the game doesn't run as good as the other versions I generally enjoy this game and the characters in it even if getting the correct stuff for character builds also an Idea for future updates make it so the base 5 stars don't appear on the special banner because I always end up getting screwed over in some way by them and being honest I want to get what I am pulling for without the fear of getting screwed over by lady luck But besids that can't wait to see where the journey takes us next,5,2024-11-20 09:53:36

"As a turn based RPG, I find that this game needs more planet exploration. Gacha wise rates are around 0.6% for a 5 star character and hard pulls/ guaranteed drops are 180 pulls. Time wise quests take a long time because you cannot skip dialogue which is a major drag in terms of time. Leveling is self explanatory and is meant to be over time. Immerse yourself in a build style that you look. RELICS are the key to strength, follow the recommendations until you figure out your characters.",2,2024-11-19 19:11:27

"Absolutely fantastic, it's deffinietly not for everyone. Disliking it simply because it's turn based is honestly invalid, because that simply meant that you dont like turn based game in general. If you like turn based strategy game, this is for you. Great story combined with great character design, charming visuals and more, i honestly think this is one of the best game i've played",5,2024-11-19 12:37:00
"one of my favourite games, been playing for well over a year, maybe two. the combat is incredibly fun and rewarding, and I love the diversity of how each character feels. the story is deep and interesting with tons of lore to unpack, the humour is very amusing, there's tons of cool story, and honestly some parts of it made me WEEP a mistake some people make is thinking this is a cheap, superficial game - it very, very much isn't.",5,2024-11-19 12:19:31

This game is amazing, and as a mobile player I can say that the controls are really easy to use, I sometimes struggle but it's alright.

"Excellent game! It's a little different by the fact that the experience you get is not just by fighting enemies. You get items from fighting certain enemies in certain areas and with these items you build up your characters. As your levels go up the items become more rare. So that is a little different, for me anyway Everything is very creative and not cookie cutter! Very contemporary in its words and actions. If your not used to turn based fighting, you will have to practice! 5⭐ So far anyway..",5,2024-11-18 08:11:23

downloaded the game to try and get sparkle as is saw she was being added and I wish I didn't this is the worst gameplay I've felt in a hoyo game if I played this before genshin and star rail I probably never would've tried those games. this games not worth suffering through for sparkle. I must say this game plays way better than the other 2 ok my 5 almost 6 year old phone but I play mainly on PC which is probably why it's also intolerable. just try other hoyo games than this,1,2024-11-10 08:06:36

"HSR is a game that accomplishes the remarkable feet of setting up an interesting concept and setting but never utilizing any of it to it's full potential. Pros: OST is great The voice acting is decent And the visuals are good Fun combat Cons: Characters, if not most of them are either bland or underdeveloped. Most of the main story plots are bloated with characters either wasting your time or repeating dialogue constantly. Or is monotone in execution. Gacha game Power creep is really bad.",2,2024-11-10 02:40:24

"One of my favourites games so far ! I kinda find the critics too harsh for a game that just got released... For these that complain about ""nothing to do, no content"" It's because you rushed it all already... I mean you can't expect in a month to have 1000 characters, 100 maps, and a ton of events and content. What's important is building your team and have your own progress, you have to be a minimum patient and it's a rpg game so I don't understand the ""linear"" complaint while there's far worse",5,2024-11-03 23:26:05

Really fun and great story,5,2024-11-03 20:09:03
pretty good. it's pretty clear what the developers want and how they achieve it. but although everyone says this. I also wish the wish system was better. it shouldnt undermine a p2w's advantages but f2p should be given a fair chance to have a bit more number of 5 star characters (not standard banner) than what is currently achievable. that too with significant grind. but a pretty polished and enjoyable game with unique mechanics.,4,2024-11-03 19:32:22
"With every new update, new characters are added, new stories, new areas, but alongside these, there should be bug fixes and optimization for low-end devices. Having a ""delete past quests"" as an option like genshin does proves super useful, decreasing the humongous amount of space this game takes.

"They're good at making us attached to many of the characters. Unfortunately, many of those characters get severely powercrept within 2-3 months. The main story is good. But if HSR was a TV show, the main arc would be like Titanic brought to TV, while the mini/filler arcs would be like Three Stooges or Charlie Chaplin. The fillers just feel incredibly out of place. Endgame modes seem clever but I can't be bothered to read through multiple pages of walls of text describing the special mechanics.",2,2024-11-03 13:00:26
It's a good game I like it so far,5,2024-11-03 10:11:55

I love this game Especialy for Aventurine☆,5,2024-11-02 11:04:19
"Yes, the game is good. If you can put up with getting a character, then them getting outclassed by another 1 update later. This is most prevalent with characters, which do a lot of damage",2,2024-11-02 07:44:25
It's funny to see how people are saying advanced players have smaller size (25-30gb) than new players (40-45gb).... because we delete the content which we had cleared 😂 it's that simple,5,2024-11-02 03:41:47
The overall game is good bit try keeping a feature to manage past quest resources so I can manage the storage hope you will hear out and do something for it It will be appreciated if you put this feature dear hoyoverse.Overall I love the Game Keep giving more updates!!,4,2024-11-02 02:02:46

"Been playing since release and honestly I truly think this is one of the best mobile games on the market. Seriously, I love the combat, the story (even a good bit of the side quests) is so good. I've been f2p except maybe a few bucks here and there and have almost every unit I care about. The only complaint I have is I think the stamina system is a wee bit too restrictive but at least it's not necessary for the story so that's a plus",4,2024-11-02 00:12:13
I love this game! The characters are great. The anime like graphics are also stunning. There are many likeable characters and the story is amazing too! The characters are not that hard to get. Overall a Great game!,5,2024-11-01 23:51:10

Bad game.,1,2024-11-01 09:24:28
Is a very fun game been playing since it came out great story and characters. I love the game so much I have two different accounts that a play on one is my main account and my second is my ftp account.

"My game blacks out when proceeding to finding the three children, I don't know why",1,2024-11-01 08:42:38
Have this game on PC and it's really fun with all the story lines. The fighting mechanics are also cool. Why are people 1 staring this game for personal problems like bro your phone witch is clearly not a device to play this game on not having enough space is NOT a reason to rate this absolute masterpiece 1 star. I dont know much about game design but I think that Unoptimizable parts of the game like textures and voices take up most the space idk I may be wrong here but my point still stands.,5,2024-11-01 08:39:52
i am very tired of clicking to complete the quests i will ask before quitting of the games please add skip button for any type of texts and quests in the game with adding a summary when i try to skip because its taking of me too much time without gaining any benefits unless wasting my time we are wanting to play not to work in the game a part timer play for fun we are not forced to engage in text we dont want it i want to play build and test my ability and the advertisement in everywhere.,1,2024-11-01 07:36:48

"Plenty of teams to build, so little jades. Good thing you really don't need the strongest versions of all teams to clear endgame stuff, at least as of 2.6. Gameplay is fun and simple, story is your typical dark Shonen plus Sci-Fi.",5,2024-10-30 09:35:15

The story is great, although I have an attention span of an ipad kid, the majority of the game is fun but when you come to mid game content or end game content you need to grind relics (essentially give additional stats to characters) but it becomes a hassle.

"Too many unskipped jiberrish dialogue, and no skip button",2,2024-10-27 15:16:34
"This game is very rewarding. However the reason I didn't give it 5 stars I because firstly the game mechanics can get VERY repetitive. As this is a turn based game and battles might be slow or boring if you play for too long. They do have an option to speed up your combat and auto fight, which makes this issue slightly more bearable. Second is the stories. They are very well written but extremely long winded. I find myself just spamming the options to carry on with the story. A skip button 🙏",3,2024-10-27 13:36:48
"The gameplay and story are solid, but pulling for characters is insanely expensive and they have a 50% chance to not even be the banner hero. The grind for materials to level up relics is super slow as well. It stops being a game and more of a second job once you finish the story.",2,2024-10-27 12:41:29

"The narrative, excluding the Xianzhou Luofu, meets expectations. However, the recent addition of missions for the Xianzhou Luofu has not only diminished the overall quality, but the new mission for Penacony has significantly lowered the standard of what was previously considered exceptional. Furthermore, the new mission involving Rappa lacks interest. Regrettably, the game appears to be declining in quality storywise.

Was a good game tho good luck for people who don't have a lot of storage space for the game as since of the new update I can't play it anymore since it takes to much space on my phone as I only have 56 GB of space in total so if you have less then that you won't be able to play unless you wanna have no images and other apps,2,2024-10-24 04:20:18

"I love this game so much, the only problem I have is that I never get five stars, I wish it was a bit easier as they only last so long, and I wish it was multi-player, but besides that I love the gameplay and designs, it's my favorite game to play when I'm bored",5,2024-10-23 10:56:59

"I love the app a lot. The game and plot is interesting. The effort they put in on their character's stories and personality is just immaculate. It's also very easy to play and farm for items needed in upgrading characters. The story is already moving quite fast. I hope it becomes more interesting as it progress. I don't like how there's a lot of imaginary characters though. Give us more options when it comes to characters. I do, however, like the puzzles and side quests this game has. <33",5,2024-10-23 09:29:53

"5 Stars with an asterisk. So I mostly play on pc with max graphical settings where this game is gorgeous and runs flawlessly (even if it makes my pc run at outer sun temp levels.) The gacha elements are really generous and you only need to save up for a few months to basically guarantee getting what you want. The story is dynamic, the characters are memorable, and the settings are gorgeous even if area are small compared to modern open world games.

Love this game sm the only thing I don't like about these types of games is that it sometimes traps you in this state where you gotta keep fighting a boss until you figure out a good team set which could take days depending on how many characters you have.,5,2024-10-23 08:51:39

"This game is EXTREMELY fun. If you have the storage, this is one of the best rpg's I have ever played. The characters are incredible, the story is engaging, and the gameplay is worth every bit of storage it takes up. If you don't like turn based games I would not recommend this game. Other than that, the end game is challenging which keeps it fresh!",5,2024-10-23 07:16:39
"probably the best hoyoverse game ever. i love the character designs, the story and its so easy to build characters. the wishing system is also easier to understand and we have a higher chance to get the five star we want! for genshin players it's probably a little weird because it's a turn based game, but imo it's much more enjoyable than most of the hyv games. i recommend it to everyone 🫶",5,2024-10-23 07:13:55

This game is good with so much cool mechanics! It's also constant with updates and releases such cool characters even in the endgame there are still many ways to get stellar jades! But it's rlly p2w since other ways to get stellar jades are involving fighting which you need to really get good cons as it is medium level to beat so I kind of hate that part but overall it's a good game!,5,2024-10-23 07:07:45

"In overall, its a decent game. It's still a gacha game, but a decent one. It addresses all the things its sister game is lacking, so the UI is smoother by a huge margin in HSR. The events are super fun and creative, and the more challenging contents just keep getting better every year. The main story is also proceeding quicker. Most importantly, I enjoyed it because their characters designs are top notch.",5,2024-10-23 06:36:15

Game is exhausting with boring storylines. Every updates takes portion of my gaming life due to forced story mode. There is no skip. Game development just sketeches anime and releases waifu so you can pull and spend money on this game.

"This has become my favorite gacha game, and I live that they keep adding qol updates. It goes a little fast some times with the release of new characters, and there is little to do once you finish the new story quests of each patch, but they come fast enough that it is manageable and they have added new game modes several times already, or updated older ones, so there's always hope for more improvements.",5,2024-10-23 03:51:14

The gacha, to obtain characters, is necessary, but you can complete the base game without spending money. Excellent graphic. Excellent music collectible inside the game. Many minigames and puzzles.

"graphics are great, story progression is ok, and i love the bgm. character designs are eh though. it's not very diverse, i get it's a chinese game but considering its global market i expected at least more diversity in terms of character ethnicity (especially skin colour) and clothing design (esp for the women since almost all the xz women have the same design motifs). often times as well it's hard to farm for relics and materials. as f2p it's manageable but a bit difficult, an ok game i guess",3,2024-10-22 02:11:17
"Honestly, best f2p game I have ever played. The story goes above and beyond for a mobile game, I'd say it's better then most triple AAA games out there currently.

I'm giving it a 2 stars because everytime in exploration progess 6 in domain combat I always gets stuck there because there is no enemy.

"Probably the best example of how a freemium game should be. Nothing is locked behind paywalls. All characters and content can be acquired freely, and gacha currency is plentiful to free players. Even events can be played after the fact, reducing FOMO. The gameplay is just right for a mobile platform, mixing standard turn based combat with immediate interruptions using character's ultimates. The final boss fights of each story arc are absolutely show-stopping in their delivery and execution.",5,2024-10-21 10:27:46

"Story and character-stories are amazing, but the turn-based gameplay is very tiring. I loved the simulated universe but even this became boring after a few weeks. Still worth 4 stars for the story, world building, character design (for Penacony characters specifically, most of the other character designs are boring at best and psychic damage at worst, as in they don't convey the job of the character nor their personality at all) and lore though.",4,2024-10-21 06:05:37

"Don't have too much gripe for the game, it is a really interesting plotline so far and good setting. However I rate 3 stars because of the graphics. I use higher end Android devices like Galaxy S and Pixel, but the game still renders at 540p even on max graphics settings. This ruins the immersion and frankly don't expect this in modern games.

"Fun game overall, but once again, Hoyoverse has an utter lack of diversity when it comes to characters. How many patches later and Arlan is the only character who's skin isn't paper white. Not to mention how they make insensitive references to slavery in his kit. I will be going F2P in all Hoyoverse games until they finally listen and make the necessary changes to include proper representation and diversity in their games.",1,2024-10-20 22:41:21

After Trailblazer level 30 the game is 95% dialogue and 5% fighting...

This dumbass game has too much dialogue. You will be spending 80% of your playtime forced to listen to fictional characters talk about their life experiences and all sorts of boring garbage. A badly written web novel pretending to be a video game is how I would describe this game. Oh and there's no skip button. Have fun smashing your buttons trying to get thru the massive amount of meaningless dialogues.,1,2024-10-20 05:59:12

"The exploration in this game is amazing. Yes, it's different from other mobile games or competitors, but there's a reason why it's doing so well. It's unique. The storyline is far better than expected. Character builds are fun to do, and the game itself is flexible. F2P friendly as well. I see other players complain about the length of the game. Well, understand that it's a literal STORYLINE. You have to have some patience in order to enjoy the game. It's great to see Devs understand the players",5,2024-10-19 02:24:16

The game play is quite fun. Character designs are really good. Storyline is very good. Turn based is alright. The movements might seem rigid but it's good.

"The graphics and animation are great, and the story is decent, but it's very pay-to-win. Rewards are mediocre. Battle-focused events (limited and perm.) are hardly doable if you don't get your hands on the latest character releases. Stellar Jade is way too difficult to come by. Gameplay and exploration are slow, bland, and repetitive. Far too much time and effort is required to build characters. This game gets boring FAST. Nothing is able to keep me hooked for more than a week or two at a time.",2,2024-10-13 12:29:56

"I've been playing since release and I have to say that it's become my favorite game of the last five years. Not just mobile games, but console games included. I really like being able to experience the story at my own pace which is often just in ten to thirty minute increments. It's pretty flexible, though, because I can spend an entire weekend day playing when that rare opportunity comes along. Would recommend for anyone who likes turn based games.",5,2024-10-13 03:50:49

Everything in the game is Amazing from personal experience. i like the character design and the animation and quality are Actually better especially the Imbibitor lunae water scene! The rewards too are very good and the characters are fast and easy to build. the Lore is a bit suprising from all the events and things that are happening but it's also pleasing and well-written. Most of the lore however are in dialogues and there's no skipping. So if you can't handle lore then don't play.,5,2024-10-12 23:13:02

"I've been playing this game since it first came out and I'm starting to realize. It will be very difficult to complete the challenge if your 5 star character don't have at least 3 eidolons. And at least if you spend enough money on one character, there will be new enemies that are so powerful that you will have to get a new character again. And the most annoying, for one character it takes a lot of materials to level up and it takes a lot of time for grinding too. Whatever, I'm quit",1,2024-10-12 07:39:15

"I played this game and finished the main campaign up to Penacony, so here's a review: the biggest success of this game is in its story and depth of the universe presented, its characters are very good and the gameplay, despite being repetitive, delivers what it promises. I intend to continue playing and following the story and updates. If you like turn-based games, I really recommend Star Rail for sure. The gameplay is very reminiscent of the games in the Persona series.",5,2024-10-11 23:44:09

"Fix these loading bugs when you can't enter the game, needing to relaunch 20 times for it to let me play. Also, not having an option to skip all these useless dialogues just shows how little devs care about players' time. I don't enjoy reading dialogues, and I skip them anyway, but wasting too much time doing so. Not to mention that there is a skip button, it appears when you need to replay some part of a quest.

"Well made but disappointing immersion. Story is paced awkwardly with Dan Heng's story being told in a split narrative as early as planet three plus the transition to Imbibitor Lunae's integration into the story being clumsy, and characters quests range from what I consider well made (Natasha) to ones where nothing happens. World building is good but has many unfortunate breaks (Seele's dress, QED.) Has a handful of deep side quests but ultimately still too messy to be good quality writing.",3,2024-10-08 22:02:21

It's only 3 Months old so it might grow into some good later but is a bad spin off of Epic 7 or summoner War currently. Great sound tracks and battle music, just like Genshin.

I've heard people discuss the story of this game and seem to adore it, but this is also a game that wants you to essentially mouse & keyboard to navigate it.",2,2024-10-07 15:16:22

"The tutorial was fun and the game is beautiful but it uses way too much storage space. The install from the Play Store is small but and there was an update just for the tutorial. Then it requires a double digit gb update. I left my phone sitting for the long unskippable update and around 10% I actually smelt my phone overheating - so I exited the app and let it cool.

"Loved this game! Until my data got deleted causing me to start the WHOLE ****ING GAME OVER!

"Amazing game. The story is definitely not for everyone because most people nowadays can't even bother to focus on something for more than 5 seconds because they have the memory and attention span of a goldfish. The only issue I would bring attention to is that cutscenes play slowly for low-end devices. You, Hoyoverse, could fix this by adding an option to replace those scenes with high resolution MP4 videos instead of actually playing out those scenes with the ingame resources.",5,2024-10-06 10:12:48

"Even after playing since launch, I really love this game. After being burnt out from Genshin Impact, i took a great liking towards turn-based mechanic. Element and Path mechanics are much easier to use and understand, unlike Genshin. Eventhough lacking a ""true"" open world, basics as jumping and often monotonous combat, but diversity in the worlds, storyline, soundtracks, endgame content ( and smile on Firefly's face ) more than makes up for the downsides & developers are actually more generous.",5,2024-10-06 06:32:46
The game is great but not the best. So I'll give 4 star but its my fav gacha game,4,2024-10-06 04:57:58
"The game is unusual slow because, the game actually loads a lot of unnecessary textures, even during the battle (even though they are 3-4 scenes that occurs during a battle, being turn based).... Why couldnt you just try to imitate the textures (i.e using a image or something) during the battle to seamless increase the frames? As such you only need just to load the enemies and the current characters. Also, I do suggest to add to the settings, the distance view, is unnecessarily too far...",2,2024-10-06 04:40:15

"There are a lot of pros (like good music, interesting characters, and a decent story), but the cons outweigh everything else. If you don't have the characters, you will not be able to complete the challenges. If you get the characters, you will not be able to use them because getting the gear takes a lot of time (sometimes months), and ressources (who are very limited). It's very frustrating building the character that you got (and sometimes paid for) due to the stats being weighted.",1,2024-10-04 18:35:46

Also the designs are getting boring. A lot of the women in Hsr have to same pants, the short tight pants (Seele, Acheron, Rappa, Feixiao, Lingsha, Sliver Wolf, and Topaz).

"Power Creep is the name of the game. This coupled with the character banners that have no relation to the plot. This impacts the story where they have to forcefully shove the 5 stars even though they have little to no impact on the story.

Decent Turn-Based Gacha Game.,5,2024-09-30 23:26:46
This game is absolutely trash the worse combat in any game I've played. Horrible horse shoe up the enemies arse type situations in this game. I'm not willing to continue playing a game where the attribute of a character is more important then the actual stats of a character. Like why did I come back to this game.,1,2024-09-30 23:08:25

Not sure if these devs are just incompetent or what. But the way the balance and handle things is atrocious. Do they wonder why it has such a Mediocre rating? Depsite the what looks like a decently quality game without a ton of mtx which in a way hurts it in terms of whales anyways. But they balance especially bosses like garbage like they don't know what they're doing. Bosses for basic story stuff feel near impossible to deal with without certain units that most players won't have.,3,2024-09-30 05:01:49

"It is such a boring game than genshin impact, genshin impact is more fun you can fight non stop, in star rail you attack one time or the enemy attack you have to go in battle round. I will say please don't play this game if you have already played genshin impact. In the fight first your turn then enemy turn. But this is not in genshin impact.",1,2024-09-29 22:15:24

"Most of the critical reviews are people who are complaining about their phone's performance and blaming it on the game. I have an s21, and it works fine. Amazing even. No stutters, less than 30 gbs, which is a bit much for cheap phones that usually have about 60 gbs worth of storage. I'm just saying, are you really complaining about the game or your phone?",5,2024-09-29 15:05:43
"I love the game but when you gotta spend nearly $300 to get a character, this game isn't as enjoyable. If it gonna take 500 pull to get one person then they need to extend the time available to get limited character. (6 months) love everything bout this game but yall pull for new character is the most ridiculous I ever seen. Like a .003% chance to get a character.",2,2024-09-29 14:44:39

"Really good game and I like it a lot. I like the story (except Xianzhou) and the character are really unique, especially making characters that is similar to other characters from different hoyo games like Bronya and Seele just to name a few. One problem that I have is the farming, it sucks. It is much better than Genshin but still terrible because there is really a really rare chance that you get a relic that you want. (Edit: Jiaoqiu and Feiziao got this up to one more star lmao)",4,2024-09-28 19:42:54
"I really love this game. Unlike Honkai Impact 3rd which is more action/rpg, this is more turn-based which suits me best. I love the depth of team building, variety of characters, and attention to detail in character animations. What irks me about the game is the constant grinding especially for different items for different characters on the same path. I am also frustrated with the energy limit and have left the game for long periods of time just to come back and play uninterrupted.",4,2024-09-28 18:55:32

"The overall quality, in terms of art, story, and animation, is good, but certain aspects of the game are just painful. Limited banners have a 50/50 chance of actually getting the character. After failing 19/21 of the 50/50s in summons, it just makes you miserable. The gear system can also ruin any excitement of getting new characters because of how bad the RNG is. It can take months to get decent gear for a single character.",2,2024-09-23 08:53:54

Came back after a while because Wuwa is too slow to add more content and got bored. How is it that this game still doesn't let you skip dialogues? It takes a ridiculous amount of time just to get through it for the actual gameplay. And forget getting new characters from feature banners. I farmed so much to be able to do 10 times the 10x summons and not even 1 yellow character. Deleting again.,1,2024-09-22 07:05:52

Since when are you going to add a system that protect unlucky player like me??? Soft pity should be 50/50 but out of 14 I only won 2 (2/14 = 14.29%)??? And I never even once seen a 5 star character before at least 80 pulls or 5 star lightcone before at least 70 pulls.

"I understand why the developers don't players to skip the story content they've spent so much time on but you simply CAN NOT force players to engage with a story they're simply not interested in.

"Too much power creep, except unlike other games that try to design unique and interesting abilities, star rail will make characters with the same kit, element and class that are just straight up better versions of old characters. Hard to get excited even for whales when new sss tier units directly make older characters obsolete since there's no balance patches either.

0.6% gacha rate with extremely hard to get premium currency is way too shameless for a gacha game. No skip on story. Pity is so far and most of the time will lose 50/50 on pity.

Wardance part 2 is hands down the worst & most unbearable event since release. Would never ever touch this event if not for Mitsuki Nanoka's final 3 eidolons.

"If data management isn't a factor for you, this game is incredible in regards to every detail that makes it. Perfect voice cast, graphics, story, fair in game currency, safe for f2p players and spenders alike, and no unit is a pressure pull--you can pull for and play whoever you want! It does take some strategizing with the end game content but thats a thrill for players who make it that far. The rewards are decent 👌 not to buy you off but to thank you for supporting the game. Worth supporting!",5,2024-09-16 02:51:23

"One of the best mobile games available. Controls are super easy for touch screens, and the gameplay itself is easy to pick up. The turn based combat requires strategy and proper team building, which makes players think about who they put in their line up. You can be completely F2P, but it'll be impossible to get every limited character. If F2P, plan out who you want in advance so you can properly save. I recommend the 30 Day login purchase if you have a bit of money on the side for more Jades.",5,2024-09-16 00:16:04

"The best mobile, cross-platform game on the market. It's an RPG, so not for everyone. The graphics (especially on PS5 and PC), characters, story, additional content, and combat are all top notch. Team synergy is much more important than just wale-ing out on characters and light cones. Only a few gripes: make a skip dialog button, cancel ultimate button, and get rid of the 50/50 pull. If we're investing into pulls, make the pity a guaranteed. Losing the 50/50 makes me want to quit playing...",5,2024-09-15 08:01:55

"Overall great game, story, animation, song and all. But it gets harder with battles as a new player with no good char especially after equilibrium upgrade, keep dying, some char build resource only obtainable 3x per week, and relics..progress is slow, so you keep struggling with mobs. And character designs, most kinda repeats the same designs, sorry but its just so plain and bland it gets boring, feel like nothing new at all. And the eyes, can it get better? Its so cartoony like a cheap sticker",3,2024-09-15 00:24:09

Honkai star rail is actually one of my favorite games the art style is pretty the game has good graphics the world's are all super pretty the story is amazing but sometimes I hate how unlucky I can get in this game when it comes to trying to a character I have never won a 50/50 yet I still think that this game deserves 5 stars. There is a lot to do this is game farming can be annoying but the story line makes up for it. Farming for the strellar jades are actually somewhat easy.,5,2024-09-14 08:10:51

"The only thing I recommend is putting in a skip button for all the storyline, just in case it's a really, really long one(there are definitely some long parts). But it is interesting. Great character designs, I love the special move and ultimate animations. Definitely 5 stars for me. I like that it's an open-world game, and the way you run around and just find certain enemies. The game isn't easy but it definitely isn't hard either. I can actually lose in this game and not even be annoyed.",5,2024-09-14 00:41:08

"Decently fun, the story is nice! Blatantly, a cash grab, but that should be expected. Honkai has an mmorpg level story that's very well done. It's honestly one of the only reasons I still play. However, let's go over the negatives. Oftentimes, there is just so much clutter in side quests and character interactions that it can be overwhelming. The drop rates are abysmal 99% of the time. You can roll 80-100+ times and not get the banner hero. The rolls are astronomically expensive as well. 3/5.",2,2024-09-13 23:22:07
"The characters are awesome, and it does not require you to spam click like genshin or zzz. However, it is a bit hard to farm warp tickets if you are free to play, and you can't skip cutscenes. Other than that, it's really good and perfect for anime simps.",4,2024-09-13 22:08:35

Worse experience with this game.. I can play until version 1.3.0 only. Devs didn't maintain device compatability. I spend $$ before now can't even play. Don't make an app with updates that's going to be incompatible to others. I had sent an objection about this.

This game is really good and I played it since the day it released but nowadays the game is too difficult that it's not even fun anymore You guys should add a world LV decrease like in Genshin or we can use food during the fight and not before the fight because it's too difficult that it's frustrating and it just makes you want to quit playing especially when you are F2P,2,2024-09-13 04:16:26

Basically half the screen becomes black and the other VERY blurry when the cutscene where she came in to help Yukong ended, I tried restarting the game but everytime it just gets stuck in the Loading screen, but I can still run around and do other stuff and even go back to normal if i return to Trailblaze POV.

The game is really good both gameplay and story wise but on mobile it can be very laggy and uses alot of ram which tends to eat through your battery so I'd recommend getting it on PC of console if possible but even if you can't the game is still really good and is a must play for fans of turn based RPGs,4,2024-09-11 21:45:21

One of my fav games it's just amazing and whenever I'm bored it's the game I go to.

The best rpg game I've played. Totally worth it One thing gone wrong. On the recent patch there was 3 rerun banner along with new character feixiao. There will be another reruns in the second phase which i didn’t like as an f2p player. As usual there should be two reruns and two new characters because many of us don’t get enough time to farm. Other than this issue I've really enjoyed playing. Keep up the good work hoyo!,5,2024-09-11 06:22:59

Game is really fun to play and build characters only problem is the devs constantly add updates and new features that require so much storage space and don't seem to bother to downsize any of the updates at all resulting in this game easily overtaking half if not most of your storage space making impossible to run the game smoothly. They should really focus on optimizing storage comsumption better or at least give us an option of what to download and what not to if we don't immediately have to.,2,2024-09-11 05:54:36

"I had really high hopes for this game, but I'm sorry to say I was disappointed. I absolutely LOVE the characters and lore and everything story based, but I can not get behind the game play. While it's visually appealing, all the ultimates take 7 years to play out and after using each one multiple times in a TURN BASED battle, it gets old quick.",5,2024-09-11 02:45:05

"One of the best games I have ever played. Everything is vibrantly alive, in art direction, story, and gameplay. While gameplay is swayed in prebuilt directions, the game allows you to do toolbox builds and even encourages it with the limited resources you normally find in a gacha. I doubt I will ever find another gacha to match. The only downside is the hard throttle on pulls due to the free to play nature of the game. It makes losing 50/50s due to only having soft pity *hurt*.",5,2024-09-11 01:11:07

"Recommended by my brother, I actually enjoyed the turn-based gameplay aspect of HSR. The storyline was a hit or miss sometimes, but I feeled Penacony is peak storytelling at its finest. Though the same cannot be said with the RNG grinding+farming of relics in the game. In fact, the hardest part players may or might not liked doing is finding the ideal main stats and substats in the style that you want your units' gears to be. It's worth the time and effort in the end once you complete your team.",5,2024-09-11 00:40:05

"The game until panacony was brilliant. The story, the characters , personalites. Everything was brilliantly done. After panacony however, the content seems to be rather "" filler "", messy/ unpolished and feels like there is no love behind the work. The latest characters are good , but the patch they come out in do not hold any standing against previous story chapters. Its as if hoyo ran out of ideas or time so mashed something together rather than something of substance. Shame",3,2024-09-10 23:45:24

very good game the only issue is that newer events require the newest trailblaze quest to be finished to evene have access to them. Till the time a new player or returning one is able to finish them they might be shifted to the perm events with lower rewards but can also not appear there and gone forever,5,2024-09-10 23:04:21
"If you're looking for a story-heavy game with lots of rewards and new game mechanics almost every patch to keep you interested and hooked? Well this game certainly takes the spot. The game and character design only adds to the flare, and not to mention the music. However, the only reason I gave 4 stars is because I would only like more representation in the game, as it would matter to the global community that the game is targeting.",4,2024-09-10 22:44:57
"This is probably my favourite Hoyo game. It doesn't have the same level of exploration like Genshin but there's still a surprising amount to discover & the stories/characters are excellent. The fighting is easy on a phone since its turn based and you can also hit auto and let it run through it for you which is soo nice for getting mats for levelling characters. Especially if you don't have so much time in your day, you can let it run while doing something else. Highly recommend this game 👍🏻",5,2024-09-10 22:41:27

"Unlike Mihoyo's other games, this is a genuinely great game underneath the monetization; to be precise, a great turn-based RPG with good writing and simple-yet-deep gameplay. Unfortunately, like them, it's still an always-online Gacha game that's absolutely ravenous for your time (and money). Getting every character and levelling them (and their equipment!) to lvl80 is painful. If you're going to play any Mihoyo game, play only this one.

"It is a very good turn-based game (mind you, I have no prior experience with any games of that genre, so I may just be inexperienced), but I am very frustrated with the same overall issue that persist through all Hoyoverse games, the main turn-off one for me being their colorism. I don't know if that is something that will ever be addressed in any way though, so for anyone else who is bothered by that issue, I'd recommend not spending any money on HSR or other Hoyo products.",3,2024-09-10 10:52:45

"I have to point out what this game is doing for new players. The endgame content now has an option for you to basically ""shortcut"" directly to it, with level-appropriate characters. You still have to be at least a third of the way through the current story, but it means new or casual players can still play the latest content if it strikes their fancy while still chugging through the dense story.",5,2024-09-10 09:36:04

Even the combat is really fun, and the team behind it has done a good job at adding new elements to the fighting system, with only one issue. A lot of ways to play the game is completely locked behind having specific characters. At least from the standpoint of creating unique teams. Other than that, I definitely recommend everyone try it",4,2024-09-10 05:36:24

"I've been in love with this game since I downloaded it in May. Combat fun and strategic, whilst also being challenging at times. The storytelling is beautiful. The developers are really generous with how much they give you - I'm free to play and still able to pull atleast 1 limited character every banner due to the free rewards. One complaint would be that the game doesn't perform greatly on a mobile device and the storage is ridiculous. But I play on my ps5 so it's not really an issue for me.",5,2024-09-08 01:09:15

"This game unfortunately runs into the same issues as every other game Hoyoverse has, and it is because of how stingy they can be, and how blatantly colorist they are. Having diversity in your game is important, and when you only have two skin tone colors to pick from, and only one character has the darker option, it is a problem. You have proven that you can make NPCs or enemies with darker shades, but refuse to give this to playable character. It's gross, simply put.",1,2024-09-07 23:41:27

"This game is better than that game which feels like a shell of an empty promise but still- (1.)Playing the story feels like playing a boring VN without the QOL settings of VNs (skip button and save button), (2.)The new characters and their introductions sometimes feel unbearable with nobody to call them out, (3.)Overuse of memes until it becomes boring, (4.)Plot holes, plot holes, and even more plot holes.",2,2024-09-07 21:32:20

My experience was fine until I opened it the second time and now it won't load ms in the game. I closed it many times and opened it again or waited for a few minutes until it took me 25 minutes. I don't know if it's because of my storage space or what that's causing the problem but my storage still has a lot of space.,3,2024-09-06 05:31:41
"This game is very fun and offers days of story quests and character quests. The combat is in depth and there are many modes that offer challenging content. It has rougelike modes offering replayability and personally I enjoy the way characters interact both in gameplay and in story. The music is phenomenal, with extremely diverse tracks for bosses and exploration that make it easy to get lost in this awesome sci-fi universe. The story is an incredibly immersive experience.

It has such a safe-by-the-books anime JRPG plot that you can correctly guess what's gonna happen, which sucks because space adventures should be exciting but it's just so dull.

"As of now I've spent more time downloading than playing. After the play store 200mb, there's 3gb before you can play, and after maybe 15-30m there's 18 GIGABYTES? The download starts without checking if there's space, and doesn't delete itself when it aborts due to lack of said space. It starts over, ignoring whatever it has downloaded before and treating it as unavailable space. Is it worth it? I'm not sure. I've not played any other hoyo game before. Edit: eh, it's more of a gacha pc game.",3,2024-09-01 20:24:51
What I don't like is it is taking up soo much of my storage .If you are start the game for the first time you have to download for the game when you press play and it takes up so much of my storage so I can't play and because the storage is to high in the game it should be lower .Because some people want to play but they can't because of storage can you please change the storage so I can't play it anymore and I really want to .,2,2024-09-01 20:00:15

This game is so freaking amazing I love everything and that you don't need to spend money to have fun or to buy summoning tickets but I would like to make a suggestion it would be awesome if it had a storage thingy like Genshin because my phone storage is almost at 100% and I don't really want to stop playing this game I love the story it's so amazing so PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE WITH A CHEERY ON TOP do the same shortage thing like genshin cuz I don't want to uninstall this game it's just too good,5,2024-09-01 06:35:13

Been playing for about a month now . Very well crafted game . Very story driven with lots of activities to do . My only real problem that I have with the game is 200 usd for a 10 pull . I understand that it is f2p and you gotta make money . But that is the equivalent of almost a Nintendo switch for a 10 pull . Do better Honkai.,3,2024-08-30 18:56:27
Uninteresting combat (it's a turn-based so). Uninteresting story. Okay character designs (Firefly is super generic why is she popular). Same gacha as Genshin.,2,2024-08-30 17:26:26

我真的很喜歡 這個遊戲 他不論是劇情 還是人物的刻畫 或是特效場景等等的都很優秀 但可能是我手機的問題吧（？ 就是很長打boss或過劇情時到一半就跳出來 導致我的秘技甚麼的都要重用 還要花時間重打 雖然隨著版本更新 沒有再發生這麼多次了 但還是偶爾會發生 希望能在改進,5,2024-08-29 18:59:19

"I enjoy it very much, but some stories take too long to conclude. It's hard when you're hyped for gameplay but you get a sort of visual novel instead. I wish there's an option to speed things up. Maybe shorter scripts? Or integrate the dialogue in the gameplay instead of forcing the player to wait for the whole convo to end.",4,2024-08-29 17:12:06

"Honestly, it's a great game. I love almost all aspects of it: the soundtrack, the easter eggs, the character design, etc. However, when it comes to storage usage, it's too big for a semi-open world with turn-based combat compared to Genshin Impact, which has a huge open world.

"Since there were no subtitles in my native language, I listened to the English voice actor and the Japanese voice in the game in order to understand the story with both of them, but I found so many difficult words that I did not understand the story.

Very fun gameplay it's story is enjoyable and engaging with twists and plenty of side content the side stories and simulated universe is amazing.The only thing I want is a easier way to get a certain character not having to use the wish system witch doesn't guarantee you someone you really want. It gives u a pool of different characters to role from kinda annoying when your favorite character goes away for 9 months. Out of any of there games it's a 5 star def recommend playing game. ^_^,5,2024-08-23 05:48:42

I prefer the turn-based combat in Star Rail rather than the real-time combat of other games with this kind of style such as Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves, and there is an option to automate combat so it makes spending energy every day feel less like a chore. Even if I don't get around to playing, the energy overflow and the big events not going away make me feel like I don't miss out.",5,2024-08-21 12:01:28

You know how to make a game fun? Make a turn based battle system but the player never gets any turns. Enemy damage is way too high compared to what your own characters get to do if you don't sink large amounts of dollars and hours into this game. EDIT: Penacony has revived all the fun that used to be missing,3,2024-08-19 15:58:03
I didn't really like it and it took 15 minutes to get it to work and it didn't even work that well on my chromebook,2,2024-08-19 15:49:46

"I've been obsessed with this game for months now but the lack of diversity and poor business planning is appalling. They over such a variety of gameplay, puzzles, etc but can't give us characters with dark skin and different body types? They ignore their customers and players constantly instead, and it's really sad to see a game with such potential be squandered by refusing to hear us out. I wish I could give this a higher rating, but not until something changes.",2,2024-08-19 00:54:31

it's disappointing how all hoyoverse games use cultures for their game excluding it's people.

I have most good characters and even with a full healer team I still die in the last phase with the boss being 37% health. Hes just way to broken to fight and overpowered. Plus the gambling aspect of it is just plain dumb. So many people struggle, and nothing changes. Please make it lower.",1,2024-08-16 21:56:07

"This is obviously better than any game of Hoyo so far, in my opinion. Rewards are generous, good art and obviously some mystery that isn't easily solved. We finally have a good black character, which I can't wait to see more of those. Designs are pretty and all, but the ads are a little scam kinda. why 3 stars? because I expect to see something better, maybe new events, especially after all that fiasco with voice actors, it's good to do a deep dive on a person's past actions.Still no jump button",3,2024-08-16 21:11:49

It's like saying, ""We like the aesthetics of your cultures but not your skin tone."", It's so shameful that a big company like Hoyo is not taking any feedback from the community and from the people that are from the cultures that they whitewash. It's not that hard to make darker skin tones. The VAs for the characters in Genshin are talking about how Hoyo is whitewashing cultures for their gain. Do better.",1,2024-08-16 10:22:49

"Overall a great game but there are a few problems No skip button; the world/side quests are extremely boring, I'm sure 90% of the playerbase would want to skip these at least. Since the main story is really good i find it fair to not have a skip button in the main story ONLY. Some bits of the main story are a bit tedious to get through because they often introduce terms that have complicated names and theyre easy to forget, so whenever its brought up, i get confused.",4,2024-08-15 20:36:51

NICE GAME!😍🥰,5,2024-08-13 17:21:16
A good game that just end up as Genshin 2. Boring fights and repetitive farming materials. New enemies design are just copy paste from another game which are better. And braindead fans called it 'inspired'. What a joke.,2,2024-08-13 16:09:44
It is one of the best game but you have to control your addiction,5,2024-08-13 15:22:23

"So for a turn based game of this nature, the dialogues can be a bit over the top, main story I find to be very fascinating at many intervals, the game is very rewarding to continue playing if you can appreciate the turn based nature. As this is a gacha of course ""just be lucky"" applies to those pulls.",5,2024-08-13 11:55:44
"This game is so much fun! I really enjoyed playing it, and the graphics are so good! In my time playing this game, I haven't spent any money, and the game still works well for me. All my characters do well, so up to this point, I don't believe you need to spend money in this game if you don't want to. I really enjoyed playing this game, and it's really fun if you enjoy action games and strategy games. :)",5,2024-08-13 06:33:34
"First off, this is the best mobile game ever created! Graphics, story, characters, and gameplay are all top tier. I can really see the TLC the developers put into the game. I even like that there is a Mercy system for the Gacha elements, although it could be much more generous... that 50/50 is trash. My only gripes are that there is no skip button for story, no backing out of Ultimates, and there's an energy system that's never enough for grinding gear and character upgrading materials.",5,2024-08-13 05:31:41
"sorry cogonosphere but you really had done agitated me with the very first boss, ""requires lvl 7 charactors, weaknesses for boss, Green, Blue, White, and Red"". it reminded me of persona games, and final fantasy games, im sorry but the moment you hit the correct hand with the correct weak element on it should instantly break the enemy, and then it should let you fight again, and again, and AGAIN, until the hand is destroyed. plus...wish google play app let me type longer compliment...

"Not for casual gaming, they will force you to grind for meta characters and specific builds, otherwise you are stuck with mainstory boss. Till new big location.. don't download it. Waste of time , as everything with Hoyo",1,2024-08-13 03:23:56
"Probably the best Hoyoverse game even developed. The story is so captivating and I played genshin before even though the game story and adventure was good the main character was average as best but the hsr developer gave justice to the main character and every characters' development was really good. How the story was developed, a lot of praise to the sotry writer. I hoper they continue with this approach what they are taking right now so the quality of game doesn't go down. Good luck!",5,2024-08-13 02:23:26

Starlit homecoming kinda sucks now because you only get one instance of double rewards rather than daily reset which is arguably better especially because of relics and simulated universe. This sucked so bad to find out because I thought it would reset and it didn't the next even though it's a measly 4 instances.,3,2024-08-12 21:11:57

"Very good game, enjoyable overall 👍",5,2024-08-12 17:54:32
"Experience playing the game has been great so far. I don't know but I just feel contents have been less and less every patch. But overall still my primary game and love playing it. It would be greater though if star rail offers coupons or decent items using play points. I'm no whale, but I do spend casually in the game and I don't want to waste all of my play points on other games I don' really love playing.",5,2024-08-12 17:49:52
"I'm just tired of horrible gear after 100 runs for a set and not getting anything good/decent, there's too many substats, and I've returned to this game thinking like why did I stopped playing it's because of that and how little you get from the character material for upgrading the skills, it cost alot each lvl but you don't earn that much, 240 fuel can get one of my character skill up by 1 and that's it at least bump it up a bit , I only get at least 1 for 60 fuel and I'm lvl 60.",1,2024-08-12 17:20:07
"I absolutely love this game. The storyline is so good, the characters have good designs(especially boothill), and cool places to explore. Overall, amazing work on this game!",5,2024-08-12 15:25:39
"Free to perform tasks anytime, plenty of extra time even for timed events. Skipping not allowed for story, and conversations are slow limited by talking speed of voice acting. Battles are lengthy due to animations, and they are not skippable, which consumes quite some time.",4,2024-08-12 14:34:45
"After Penacony and we went to Xianzhou again, it made me lose interest quick. And also the system that made you lose repeatedly, if you don't have the character on the new banner, doesn't feel good. So I quit. It's just a grind machine now.",5,2024-08-12 14:08:43

"Not mobile friendly. None of hyv's games are. And the community and lack of the company's commitment to take responsibility and addressing these concerns has discouraged me from playing entirely.

"Got very boring after penacony, it was fun for a little but the combat did get boring, & it's 2024 and the blatant colorism in all their games and especially so in there upcoming natlan is absolutely disgusting. Please listen to your players and your GLOBAL audience, you cannot borrow from cultures and then mock their deities and leave their people behind. I will not be giving this company money or playing their games until they properly respect the cultures natlan takes from. Fix the skin tones",1,2024-08-11 00:53:03

"Overall amazing game with great story experience (Penacony arc was the best) and characters. For some of y'all who are talking about Chris, Hoyo did not hire him personally, the VA studio did. And even though it has the same problem as Genshin, hsr is not even related to Natlan.",5,2024-08-10 18:24:53
"Was going great, I probably had spent $70.00 and was at level 70, then suddenly the game lost data and set me back to level 17 where I had been when I stopped playing it for about a year. I quit, I'm not doing all that again. Nothing from tech support so far.",1,2024-08-10 18:24:26

It was a really good game! But there's a bug when i have to finish the moles sides quest.. it seems like i can solve the riddle by placing the crates in the middle after i pick it up the top crates. I hope Hoyoverse can fix the bug for me because i REALLY loves this game,3,2024-08-10 08:16:41

I dislike being stopped every five seconds for a conversation with a five year old (your accomplice has the single most annoying baby voice) and to have repetitive battles in which you hit one button, wait, hit another button, wait, and so on.

"It was fun while it lasted. I could play this on my phone but after many updates, it has finally become similar to my problem with Genshin Impact: phone storage.

Good story fun game reminds me little of final fantasy. Has turn progression for combat. Love the travel aspect and finding disc for music. Wanna say after a certain lvl the game gets rather competitive you have to grind to certain lvls in order to progress in the storys. I stopped playing cause I didn't want to do side objectives cause they generally didn't go well with the story lines and you have to travel back and forth and teleport away from you main quest line area.,4,2024-08-07 10:48:34

"Honkai: Star Rail is one of the best games I have ever laid my hands on, but recently, it would glitch here and there, which is no problem. However, as I continued to enjoy the game and clear the apocalyptic shadow, it would just crash whenever I tried claiming my rewards, and it would also crash anytime I played more than and hour and a half, this problem is probably from how the game is optimized. Ultimately, hsr is an amazing game. All they have to do is fix some things here and there. 🙂",3,2024-08-05 19:01:38

Amazing game! Love it but it's almost impossible each update to make space for it. Not mention lagging on my device when it comes to cutscenes. Or certain fights... As of right now I can't find a way to make enough space for the next update. So I will most likely be dropping it. Definitely would be better on PC if I had one.,3,2024-08-05 11:44:42
Its a really nice game if you have a good f Phine its very fun I never get board,5,2024-08-05 10:42:49
"I've played the game since released and honestly I'm no longer enjoy the game like I used one year ago. As a husbando enjoyer I can't help but notice just how different the treatment between male and female characters, like, male being easily replaceable unit and powercreeped by the girls. HSR is a good game, really, but if you're a husbando enjoyer like me, better think twice than swallow bitter pills.",1,2024-08-05 08:54:51
"HSR is a turn based RPG with an interesting sci-fi setting and fun characters. It's a free to play game with a gacha system for gaining new characters. There are many aspects of this game that are amazing, particularly the art direction, music, and writing. There are also some aspects that aren't that great like farming equipment for your characters and the fact that it's a gacha game. If you like turn based combat and are fine with gacha games, this is a must try.",5,2024-08-05 07:06:34

"I like the story, characters, art style, voice actors, music, and humor. I rarely (if ever) have performance issues. The combat is simple yet diverse; allowing for a multitude of beginner to try-hard strategies in the many end-game modes. Auto-battling boring material farming is a nice feature. The devs are generous with free pulls, and I never felt like I must pull a character to progress in the game since they usually have bonus mechanics that you can utilize to win a battle.",5,2024-08-04 23:47:45

The story is great, the events are generous, the characters are immersive, the game performance is a bit laggy and glitchy but it's quite considerable because I use an old phone, and it's F2W friendly. The only problem is the relics. The odds for a good relic is so low that it's getting really hard to even reach the recommended stats of each character. Even with resin, the odds are still incredibly low.",5,2024-08-02 14:31:52

In my game nothing actually lags too much to be pixeled or crash the game. The game is great on PC and phones. The character development,their personality and designs are perfect!

"I adore this game! As a person who tried Genshin Impact after starting this game, I can say that I got board of Genshin in less than an hour, unlike here where there is always something going on. I love this game so much, and I would recommend this to anyone who has played Genzhin before or never played any Hoyoverse games before. ♡♡♡♡",5,2024-07-31 22:12:37

Wonderful game,5,2024-07-31 21:07:31
"Literally an easy game where you can set the battles to auto while you do other stuff. But if you do want immersion, dialogues are funny and the story is engaging. Lots of fun events and plenty of characters you'll like. Money doesn't need to be spent to have fun, but still that's up to people. I finished Pencony's story, and I have no plans to uninstall with how good we're getting fed.",5,2024-07-31 21:06:50

"It's a great game with a lot of memeable contexts and fun interactions and gameplay. The turn-based combat is resfreshing and eye-pleasing. It also doesn't burn you out with a lot of actions you have to press on the screen. It's just casual and relaxing. I love how the MC is just goofy and chaotic compared to other typical heroic MC. Overall, it's a great game! Highly Recommendable!",5,2024-07-31 19:59:04

Relic system is dogshit. It have so many layer of RNG. You can farm relics domain for 1 year & more but still couldnt get suitable main stat & correct 2 piece / 4 piece set for your characters. Relic that we get from farming / self modeling resin should at least have 2 good substat. Flat ATK & HP should only exist as main stat. Chance are there some useless substat get level up more than important one for your DPS or support. Devs should make filter tool to counter all this .,1,2024-07-31 18:39:20

"Too many unnecessary dialogs in side quests. I understand we cannot skip main story quest but we also need to spend on ridiculous time on side quests dialogs for turn based rpg where most of the time we play auto?

"This game is turned based, but has a great storyline, and great graphics and art work and overall sometimes forgiving to the players, and made by the team from genshin, I approve this game. This from now on is an edit:I am finding amazing fun within this game, but I can't beat a boss without some trace materials from aventurine so I could beat a certain boss(no spoilers) and to get those I need to defeat a boss which is maximum level and is too hard even for my practically max team. I beat it!",5,2024-07-31 10:34:52

But the main problem I am facing currently is that the game takes up alot of space on my phone , almost 1/4 which is why I would like to suggest the game devs to make a similar feature to that of genshin impact which allowed us to delete already played content like previous story date like cutscenes, story, unused items,etc.",4,2024-07-31 06:45:06

As fun as this content is, it's all downgraded as a whole when they choose to market towards vulnerable people who will do anything to pay for whatever anime characters they want to goon to. Hoyoverse has, time and time again, used real things from real cultures, names, people, and deities.

"Very good game. I like the turn based combat and the neat voice acting for characters. All the different planets look unique and I enjoy each one. Things that kind of icks me is that it takes up a lot of storage, I had to delete multiple apps just to keep playing. There are also quite a low number of 4 stars, and lack of design diversity.

But for what it is, it's an interesting take and a fun one at that, despite being annoying with the ultra mega hard bosses and the competitive nerds almost ruining the fun lol.",4,2024-07-31 04:05:38
I very rarely finish mobile games but I completed the story. If you like anime/RPG's this is for you. The only downside would he the rate for grinding tickets but you don't need to spend money to win. Great graphics and many things to do.,5,2024-07-31 03:09:32
"Great game although there's some graphical glitches when I use my Samsung s10e on a screen recorder, the glitches do fit the game tho ngl",5,2024-07-31 00:32:05

"I love this game! I started playing around patch 2.0 and have loved it since. Though I have played other games as well, this one stands out for its consistency, awesome story, and straightforward mechanics.",5,2024-07-30 22:21:59
"Game is great. Like any other game, it's a gacha, but they do give a ton of free pulls and opportunities to get free pulls. The character designs are very cool, but unfortunately mihoyo doesn't believe in buffing or reworking older characters, so be prepared to have a lot of characters you don't use. Gameplay is great, story can get overwhelming or confusing, but overall pretty good. However, the stories are world by world so previous events tend to not effect the current story. 8/10",4,2024-07-30 22:15:24
I'd wager it's the best turned based gacha on the market. A lot more chill and laid back than Hoyo's other games.,5,2024-07-30 21:40:34

"In terms of how fun the game is, it can certainly win the other games like Genshin or Zenless Zone Zero even if they are all different in terms of gameplay. Nowadays people want a game that doesn't take up too much time but can still attract their attention span so this is a really good game to start with. The developers have been constantly improving the game so it makes it a lot easier to finish up daily task or even difficult bosses. This game doesn't take up a lot of battery too.",5,2024-07-30 18:47:38

"after playing for more than a year I have to reevaluate this game, it's quite f2p friendly but at the same time is a bait for banners really no matter how you look at it the game is ridiculous overpaid per 5* as this review the price per unit is more than 640$ USD putting it on the top of NO GAME TIER",2,2024-07-30 10:18:40
The game is excellwnt but there is only one problem and that is the content of the game after you finish main and side quest all you can do after is farm items and wait till next patch for like 2 months,5,2024-07-30 10:05:32

I do the puzzles I do as much as I can I do everything to play but I can't it's just the start screen it's so bad fix this,1,2024-07-30 09:12:19
I love this game. It is a turn based game with a unique/well designed story taken place on a space train! The characters have unique styles and back stories even the 4 star ones. The best cones are easy to get in the game. You get an easy 5 star pull right from the geico. The enemy types are varied but gameplay will get repetitive if you are a F2P. Recommend for high end devices!,4,2024-07-30 08:53:43
Perfect Turn based game i ever played,5,2024-07-30 08:37:25

I haven't even gotten the chance to play anything because the farthest the game will allow me get on the loading screen is 20% before lowering itself and restarting the process. I was really excited to play but couldn't. Not even on my wifi will it load. I'm hoping this issue will resolve itself by re-downloading the game, but I'm not so sure.",1,2024-07-29 21:41:42

"A very charming game. Turn based combat, OST that fits the ambiance, fairly unique characters (Boothill my beloved), and a gacha system that isn't unlike any of Hoyoverse's other games, same pity, same rules. The story is intriguing, but knows not to take itself too seriously at times. The main trio are fun to follow around as you travel different planets, solve the big problem with the people of each planet, leave, rinse and repeat. Overall, an enjoyable experience.",4,2024-07-29 07:25:02

"I had play this game for a few months when it released , and I got bored of it after the release of sliver wolf. Most of the characters are not unique, is same the character models reuse just with a add on tail or horns ,and the gameplay is too boring there is only 2 options per character to use in any fight ,which is a bad design soon there will be a character with 3 options to choose and it will power creep the game. Lastly the storys some I like some is ok but there are too many boring ones.",1,2024-07-28 15:26:23

"Awesome game so far,haven't played much,but I hope like many RPGs,it has an end so all the combat has a payoff,and some satisfaction to it. Unless there's an end to the main story,and the post game stuff is just ""do whatever you want,have fun!"" But I hope there's an end is some form. I don't like games that don't have an end. Even Minecraft has like end credits,though afterward,you can do whatever. I'm not far,so my rating is high. It's fun so far. I hate the doomsday beast though. Hope it sufer",3,2024-07-28 10:53:44

"I want to love this game... The characters and story are very good, along with the cinematics and story, but the gacha system ruins the whole experience. The feeling of missing the 50/50 soft pity and having burnt all those resouces for nothing, ruins any enjoyment I got out of the rest of the game. Having spent actual money on it makes it even worse. So thank you HSR for helping me to stop playing.",2,2024-07-28 02:04:25
"Simply the best turn-based RPG gacha around, and imho Hoyoverse's best. The graphics and character design are gorgeous, gameplay is engaging with lots of different modes, story is solid and the world engaging. Just a fantastic game, really fun and perhaps most importantly, it respects my time as a gamer. In a market saturated with gachas, it has become so valuable to me when a game respects my time and rewards my efforts accordingly.",5,2024-07-28 01:54:11
"A perfect game. Best turn-based since FFVII I haven't been interested in turn-based games in a long time, especially since WoW. I tried this because I loved Genshin Impact and I wished to learn more of the story from their shared universe. I found that not only is it awsthecially beautiful, but the gameplay is exciting and interesting. But more importantly, there's solid endgame and the devs listen to you. They give you a free limited 5* and the gacha is decent if you plan your pulls.",5,2024-07-28 00:35:42

I am quite happy with the characters as compared with the 5 or so try-hard influencer wannabe woke trolls in the comments with 50 accounts each trying to push their dark skin agenda for ugly game chars. But I am stopping this game due to the repetitive nature and weighted bad RNG that ensures you get nothing good. That is the real issue and not the nonsense from the couple hundred accounts in the past few days. Stop being greedy.,3,2024-07-27 10:24:17

"I love this game so much, I play it every day, but I hate fighting bosses. The bosses always get multiple turns per one of my characters turns and it's unfair because the boss does more damage than my characters, and they keep locking my characters so I can't use them. For example, freeze. If let's say my dan heng is frozen, his turn will be later, and even he doesn't attack, he only recovers. Then, the boss freezes him again so I have no chance to use him.",2,2024-07-24 02:49:18

"I used to rate this 5 stars, but man, Penacony's quest is so boring. It's like everybody suddenly decided to do theater. Dialogues are too lengthy and trying so hard to sound deep, that it became hard to understand. (Mr. Sunday, please stop talking about the caged bird!) Also a lot of lengthy flashbacks to build character instead of incorporating it bit by bit to the current story. Weak writing. Compare this to Bellobog's story where the dialogue has enough depth but still easy to understand.",3,2024-07-23 13:29:44

Sometimes when I start it up, it closes on me and I need to restart the app. The biggest issue in game is that the story bosses are so much harder than after you defeat them and go back to do it again. And then you can't defeat a boss and get quest locked and can't do anything, including events, quests, and exploration.",3,2024-07-21 23:46:14

"This game is really good with voice acting and all sorts of things. I play this game on my laptop, but I wish I could play it on my phone. It takes up way too much storage for most phones. Also I am a bit confused to why there's little people with darker skin tones.",3,2024-07-20 11:43:08

"The character design can sometimes be amazing, but sometimes, some characters end up looking the same. The lack of diversity on color schemes for characters makes them hard to tell apart.. and not to mention the skintones... Based on your companies other games, it's apparent that you can design characters with darker skintones, but it's disappointing that you use it on everything except the playable characters.",1,2024-07-20 11:05:24

"Good experience, although some aspects as the importance of leveling up your characters, weapons and choosing the right elements is a big let down. Wish the game could remind us to level up our stuff.",4,2024-07-20 08:20:06
Incredibly fun. Enjoys the story. And characters are all fun to use and mess around. Especially the 4 stars characters. It's not perfect but still. Very fun and generous reward for f2p,5,2024-07-20 07:14:06

"Firstly, as every hoyo game, this one also has a wonderful aesthetic world to it. The characters are stunning and everything is well put together. There's many challenges, which can be hard, but still doable! There's a lot of things to do and every time new enemies drop characters rotate in the meta. I've never had any bugs or problems with the game and I haven't met any Toxic players. Perhaps it's maybe not very f2p friendly in the endgame, but still not a big problem.",5,2024-07-20 03:07:34

"Really good game! Honestly, I found the turn based gameplay to be a bit easier to get a hang of & follow, & the story quests are pretty good, too. However, I do wish some of the bigger fights were just a tiny bit easier. Some of them just drain my motivation trying to beat. Overall, 4/5.",4,2024-07-20 00:54:49
Y'all it's so fun and refreshing. It's cute when it wants to be it doesn't take itself too seriously. The music is amazing. The community is fun and it's just because it's so popular that there is bound to be toxicity. Don't mind those loud voices. Most of us are having a great time enjoying a great game by a great company.,5,2024-07-20 00:23:02

I really don't enjoy the game but the biggest reason it's one star review is on the second day of having this game it toke over 20 gigabytes of space for this dumb game like if I even want to play this (which if it didn't take so much space would be a 3 star review) I have to delete like 5-10 other of my apps to fit this game like it not even worth wasting time on this game. The game is really mid like not to much action,1,2024-07-19 13:27:25

I only wish there was a way to send your friends some in-game currencies like stellarjades, credits and all that, because I have a few friends who want to play but are discouraged bcs they don't want to spend too much on this game.",4,2024-07-19 11:06:38

"Good game, terrible diversity. All games from this company suffer from this issue. In honkai star rail there's only one darker character, in genshin all the characters based off of real cultures are heavily white washed and as far as I know there's no in ZZZ (although I haven't played so I might be mistaken). Worst one is in HI3rd, where a character literally bleached her skin cause it was ""too dark""!????!

Well I started playing 2023 at first it's boring uninstall it and came back 2024 Feb I regret uninstalling. I stop at jarilo VI very first mission Came back 3 months have knowledge about the game how to build character now I finished penacony #ferwellpenacony thank you for the experience I miss out a lot now waiting for the next chapter of trailblazing.,5,2024-07-17 02:38:02
ITS AMAZING. I think the game is great overall. It gives good rewards in game which allows you to easily get The 5 star characters you want and even they're lightcones.(They're weapons pretty much that increase they overall stats) I really enjoy the story mode. The music is great. They give you plenty to do early in the game and even later in there's always challenges you can do. I really enjoy the game keep up the good work,5,2024-07-17 02:29:00

I adore this game. However the lack of diversity regarding skin tones is very disappointing. Not to mention how the few characters who have darker skin are gray. Please make more colored characters and please give their skin some actual warmth. Not to mention how Arlan's skill names come off as incredibly ignorant. I've been told that they do not even align with his story as a character either.,1,2024-07-16 21:13:54

Love the artwork. Love the story. Love the aesthetic and the Atmosphere. The graphic are great. They look detailed and interesting. Even the low power characters look cool.

If you're going to profit off of people's cultures, PROPERLY REPRESENT SAID PEOPLE. This also goes for Sumeru and Natlan from Genshin Impact.

I genuinely was hoping that with penacony we'd at least get some new poc characters because the planet is based on jazz but alas that's not the case. I was also surprised that adventureine was white washed. If you're gonna base new planets off of black culture at least have good representation. Hoyoverse do better.",1,2024-07-16 11:16:29
"The drama around Hoyo is insane and is being pushed by the actual racists LMAO Also, let's see them playing these games in a month again after some cool reveal, because they don't have spine.

"I've been playing since release and honestly I should've done this earlier. Please address the blatant colourism in your games. For Penacony to have taken inspiration from the Jazz age which was pioneered by black people you refuse to release any characters that aren't white. Aventurine being inspired by Romani yet you whitewashed him. Arlan being the only ""dark"" character and having racist names for his skill and ultimate.

New Edit: I have fallen in Love with this game all over again after playing it on PC. Wow! I know it's not the same as it is on mobile. It is just continuously getting better and they're constantly updating it. So much so that you can never really rely on things staying the same as they're always trying new things.

"The game is very good! Much better than Genshin and is less stressful, whilst also giving more rewards. Yes, characters get released more often, but many times a 4-star can substitute it's role. I'm however dissapointed in the lack of skin tone in most characters. They're quite pale and characters such as Aventurine would have benefitted from more melanin, considering that his story is most probably based off of real slaves.",4,2024-07-15 07:51:54

Make darker skin tones. Stop white washing your damn characters and add more poc in them. Stop adding colorists and racist in your game.

Some fit with the Scfi nature, but others have no place in a setting such as thus game. Combat is genuine repetitive to the point of a being a chore to do. Grinding so many stages just to have a decent chance at a boss or encounter. Gacha sucks as per Hoyo games. Having to wait banner after banner till the unit you need (not want) shows up again.

"Been playing about a week now. I will update my review as I play more. Using a S24 Ultra to play. So far this game is mind-blowing. Graphics and style 5/5. Voice acting is 5/5, Combat is 4/5 only because for me it is a lil difficult to understand want elements are strong/weak against what. The break/stun system is great but a bit confusing to understand what element is going to be better for causing the effect. And maybe an auto-travel to objective would be nice as well. Not enough space for mor",3,2024-07-13 01:40:55

Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if the standard banner characters were good, but the vast majority are garbage. I will take my money elsewhere.

Hope y’all love it as much as I do!Edit: after they added the new character Acheron I have been having an absolute blast forever!Another thing is that even 4 star characters are viable for endgame content.My favorite 4 star can keep up with the dps's.

I just got a piece for my Firefly, after 2 long weeks of farming, with just 1 useless stat...guess what. It went HAM on this stat, rendering the piece absolutely worthless. We need more options for artifacts, such as reward artifs with preset stats, ways to roll out a worthless stat for another, or reset.",1,2024-07-08 21:00:28

Given up on playing this game and move on to fine a better game.But the story is good ngl. Unfun to play the game where not getting the character for specific game mode or mechanic.Can clear but not fully getting all the reward. Always feel left behind and under performance for every event. Guess only streamers and huge spenders can perfectly clear to grab all the rewards. Still grinding for relic sets for stats but to no avail. 80summon win once then lose 3 everytime. Playing fgo till this day.,1,2024-07-07 02:09:49

"The story can be insanely yappy like Genshin without a skip button. At least not that I'm aware of at the time of writing this review. Luckily, the story is good by gacha standards. The designs are top notch as expected from a Hoyo game. All the QoL that was missing in Genshin Impact is given here. Worth your time if you wanted more end game from Genshin Impact, you like like turn based RPGs, you like anime aesthetics, you want to collect waifus & husbandos, or all the above.",4,2024-07-06 02:44:35

"0/5 They make this game too hard. Why do I have to take extra time to look up guides for everything. They force you to play certain teams or you die. Can't use the characters you want to use or you die. You have to use certain characters to win. Only one path. So stupid. 7/24 Update: Still the same. Shallow, dumb combat. Worst turn based I've ever played. Char designs are bland, no interest. Gave it 2nd chance after a year. Still trash.",1,2024-07-05 19:25:29

"The constant grind for materials to activate character traces, ascend units/light cones is not great, and the hunt for relics is beyond time-consuming, a fact that's further driven home by the stamina system. That said, the stories are a great time, environments are gorgeous, and the music is incredibly good (massive props on the Penacony update!). There hasn't been a true lack of missions to take on for the months I've played, something that's pretty wild to me. I'll play for a while longer!",3,2024-07-05 14:14:29

And what's even weirder is that it's only on the American server. I'd appreciate greatly if this could be fixed, because it affects whenever I travel (enemies can ambush me freely), during quests (it makes the quest dialogue reload from the start), and overall anything else outside of battle.",3,2024-07-05 04:43:44

Don't understand why to give almost 0 probability for good characters when there's no competition between people. You are going to lose players.",2,2024-07-04 23:36:23

"Best game I've ever played. The graphics is nice, the story is nice and I really like the characters. This game makes me comeback to it everyday to farm relics and upgrade characters to beat harder content like MoC. I honestly don't get how people rate this 1 star. To people who rates this 1 star because of the bad Rng it's not the games fault your unlucky. I have won and lost a lot of 50/50's but I don't blame the game because I know the rng entirely random. Keep up the work Hoyo",5,2024-07-04 14:22:05

"Out of all the Hoyo games this one is by far my favorite so far. The charcters and story are beautiful, and I can't just get enough of it. This is also their one and only game where it feels like they actually take feedback and listen to you, as well as giving to their F2P player base. It's easy to get characters you want, as I was able to get Aventurine and Boothill easily as a F2P player. By far the best game they've made, and they actually listen to their player base and take in feedback.",5,2024-07-04 13:43:43

Good but grinding for relics is annoying and you have to worry about the right main stats and the substats plus like genshin the pity sometimes resets after losing the 50/50 plus your characters won't do 100k and over DMG unless their crit DMG is above 100 and crit rate is 70 and above,3,2024-07-04 11:22:01

"Considering its popularity and me having already tried it before, I went back into this game skeptical, expecting to give it a lower score. Yet, the game surprised me with its detail and depth of content. The story is more spectacle than substance, but it is confident in that identity. Gameplay is diverse - one moment you are badass fighter, next you are a puzzle solving explorer, and after that, you are a museum manager, warehouse manager, ghosthunting influencer with unique mechanics to match.",5,2024-07-04 00:39:22

"Story started strong in Jarilo-VI, got lost in Luofu, and then crashed and burned in Penacony. Gameplay HEAVILY incentivizes playing the flavor-of-the-patch meta. Unfortunately, building one character takes 5 amber eras, so by the time you've built the new team, the meta has moved on. Furthermore, perhaps because of player demographics, the game is turning into shameless bait for waifu simps. Player community also suffers from a perennial chip in the shoulder about Genshin.",1,2024-07-03 20:21:55

"Compelling imersive visually and audibly beautiful with whimsical side quests. Reasonably free to play‐able. (Good f2p value) The downside is that it is an over 22gb download by the 3rd act (world), and this is a cosmic train. I dont forsee having enough room to finish it. This just isn't my favorite gameplay to give up 22gb. I dread launching it for the massive updates. I'm willing to chance finding a game more my interest while I play my 2 to 7gb games.",4,2024-07-02 13:33:05

Very fun and Enjoyable. Been playing for over a year now. Story rich & characters are very likeable. Welt is a King.,5,2024-07-02 09:31:58
"Constant regular player for longer than a year. Great game Just one major complaint. Aside from the need of new chars for new mechanics and such which i understand is needed to keep players keep pulling. Previous events take up a lot of space. I wish there was an option where we can install and delete past event resources if and when we want, while keeping the memory of how far we've gotten in them.",4,2024-07-02 09:08:48
I got to level 50 after two to three months of playing and buying a few add ons. Then I didn't play for two or three weeks and literally all my progress is gone. This game is a waste of time.,1,2024-07-02 09:08:07

"Combat is really hard in the early game but when you reach endgame it should be really easy. the universe challenge should be very easy since you can just use the path of nihility,hunt,erudition to make it easy and for pure fiction just make teams of different play styles like dot,dps,follow up attacks, and super break since the buffs change per version. and finally the last endgame content memory of chaos this mode is a bit easy since all you need is proper understanding and good characters.",5,2024-07-02 05:35:58

"The Game is fine and all, but I don't really like it that much. Idk why, it's not so laggy like Genshin but it's still a good game to play, but the more you level up the harder things you need to ascend your charaz. That's why I'm giving it a four ⭐. Genshin is probably better because I'm almost finished with it, but Honkai star rail is a good RPG game just like Genshin!",4,2024-07-01 15:50:47

Gim baik 👍,5,2024-07-01 09:31:27
"It's really pretty and well-made, but the gameplay itself isn't fun. 97% of the game is menu navigation and dress-up walking simulator. If you're into micromanagement and really like the characters you may enjoy it. The gameplay itself is nothing more than navigate character through tunnel to objective, click to start a fight, then the most basic of basic turn based combat. Then you spend 3x as long clearing notifications, then repeat.",2,2024-07-01 08:45:06

"Other than losing every 50/50 (I lost 5 in a row with everything on hard pity and getting the guarantee on hard pity as well), up to the writing of this review, the game is great. Good graphics, mobile optimization and ping. Great story and content, although endgame could use some work. Because of my somehow bad rng, even with most relics, the game just feels like a chore, wherein I put in all the effort just to get nothing in return. Its sad because I loved playing but now it just a stressor.",2,2024-07-01 03:24:24

"I love this game. It has amazing story and characters, the combat system forces you to really think about team comp and have a good understanding of how characters work together to synergize. The visuals are out standing and I really feel like this is the best hoyoverse game that's currently out. However I feel like the grind of getting materials and leveling and getting better relics can get old after not seeing good relics for weeks at a time (it might just be my luck) as a f2p player",4,2024-07-01 02:29:01
Skill issues everywhere i like the game,5,2024-07-01 02:28:52
"I'm in love with this game! In my opinion, there hasn't been a better story than Penacony in any other game. The characters, cutscenes and the environment are very unique for every update. I would to love see where the Astral Express takes us next!!",5,2024-07-01 02:26:25
"This game is a huge upgrade to genshin. The story, character design, environment design, events, and especially the music are top tier. Everything that genshin lacked, this game improved on it. Except of course it still doesn't have a skip button but it doesn't really matter since the side quests doesn't really drags you with very long dialogues, it is rather very compact and quick to do. And the story quests really pulls you in and makes you more immersed to the story.",5,2024-07-01 02:03:22
I mean like I love the game its great over all but it took up ALL of my storage to where i couldnt even do basic things on my phone and i had 150 GB of storage!! And i have like 5 other games and mostly apps thats INSANE!!,3,2024-07-01 00:53:10

Okay. Coming back to this review after playing around a little bit more and I have to say it's actually pretty fun. The humor can be kind of hit and miss the story is a little bit dull at times but overall it's a neat little game. However some of the boss fights and enemies seriously need to be nerfed. Cough cough Gambler is all I'm going to say. On top of that the pulll rate for characters should be way higher because half the time you're just pulling those memory things.,3,2024-06-30 22:15:24

"Fantastic game! The story is immaculate and I love all of the character interactions! Characters aren't too hard too get if you put in a lot of effort and rewards are worthwhile! The only issue I have with the game is the amount of storage. Though I come from Genshin, it still takes a lot of storage. My phone has only 64 GB and this takes up more than half. There are many things on my phone I physically can't get rid of and it makes it hard to scour my phone each update for things to delete.",4,2024-06-30 18:54:06

This game is an absolute travesty compared to genshin. It's greedier considering most characters are just going to underperform and suck without their light cone. And some characters just straight up suck without 5 stars. It's most recent Penacony story is nothing but a giant waste of time that's all spectacle and no actual thought yet it drags on forever with the most contrived plot ever conceived. Do yourself a favor and refrain from downloading this.,1,2024-06-28 10:34:45

Dude its an amazing game but taking up over 20 gigs on my phone is not diabolical to you guys??? Its like you want my fingertips burned clean off the way this game overheats my phone.

"BECAUSE OF THIS GAME MY BFF STOPPED TALKING TO ME.. She now only talks about Aventurine this, Aventurine that.. who tf is Aventurine????? 💀☠️☠️☠️ Pls delete him from the game or something, I just want someone to gossip with and now I cant because anything I tell her she just answers facts or things about Aventurine.. he is even that amazing 😡.

"I think the new planet is cool, but the bosses like Sunday and Aventurine are too strong and hard to deal with for free to play players, Aventurine's bossfight took me 3w to finish, and Sunday's boss fight is too hard, it likes the game isn't even playable if you don't have strong characters like Fu Xuan or Acheron. Acheron is way too hard to build for free to play players, which sucks a lot. Sunday on the other hand, is too strong and needs to be nerfed many times.

Seems like it'd be a good game but it almost exploded my phone. If you have an older android I would not get this game. Firstly it requires a TON of space and is too much for my phone to run once it is downloaded. I played for maybe 15 minutes before my phone got so hot I was genuinely concerned it would catch fire. I put my phone in the freezer than immediately deleted this game I have not had that overheating issue before or since.

Missing QOL adjustments to be a great turn based game. Needs a skip button for dialogue. Most side quests are unbearably long winded. Summoning materials are abysmal to acquire being F2P and even if you did spend its outrageously expensive. Taking months to saveats for a limited character to just lose the 50/50 at pity is demoralizing to say the least. Game definitely doesn't reward your time. Story is ok some characters are more annoying than it should be for how much dialogue there is.,3,2024-06-25 17:39:46

"As the game updates, it somehow gets worse. Main quests're just...not clicking anymore. Penacony's unnecessarily long and the ending wasn't satisfying in any way. A lot of stuff to remember the story, too much information. How am i supposed to remember all of those? Plus, the relic rng. I think it is pretty obvious, it has the sh*ttiest system i've ever seen.Three flats with the repeating defense main stat??I need decent relics at least if i cannot get the characters i want. And lag got worse.",3,2024-06-25 15:57:33
"They should rename the game ""just running around"". Or longer ""just running around,solving lame puzzles,engaging in even lamer unskippable dialogues"". Farewell penacony reads like a 10th century novel and a dystopic social experiment not to puke outta boredom. Let us skip the torturous dialogues, I promise it will be the qol upgrade of the century and improve store rating.

So called the Tech Otaku will never save the world. The game only tells me the power of money. It sells 3d models and that's all. The original Mihoyo long gone. A good game makes people think more but not pay more.,2,2024-06-24 22:31:21

"Actually one of the better games this company has made. honestly its way too much talking, And it has nothing to do with the actual story plot. you guys need to add a skip dialouge option as alot of the story dialouge is comparable with a Naruto filler ark. The same tired fetch and run quests do not offer any real character development.The main character is awful, no signifigance. You all are ruining a good game with poor side quests that are too long to be pointless. Good game 3 stars at Best",3,2024-06-24 11:06:19

(I know, heard it here first) As a small spender i am happy to drop £20 or so a month if it will give me good value but there's not really much for people who want to unlock lots of characters and only at E0. Whales will spend big for E6, but I am happy with E0 and currently there's no way to pay to play at that level. So my options are grind or skip. I work full time so i can't grind.

Horrible character and light cone (weapon) rates. Pulling the gacha is a miserable experience! Not fun. Penacony update: i regret coming back!! That last boss was utter garbage!

"seriously, people does not talk much about the grind in this game. Like for example, rng on relic sub stat is so random that make us want to grind more. It does not allow us to choose whatever we want. Like this game is not for the people who only can spend time on weeekend. Once you fully build up your team, you just switch off your brain and press autoplay, not really using much strategy at the endgame. One other things is we can't rewatch the cutsence that's been completed.",1,2024-06-23 17:56:26

"Played from day 1. Story wise, it's a blast. Sadly, even 1 year has passed, Devs keep nerfing male unit before release. Male chara are ""subpar"" all around. Their damage-maximised output have to be paired to (harmony) unit, which is a female chara too. So The game is heavily centered around Female units to be meta. I hope they can balance out the performance for each gender units. Man, We deserve what we pay. Look, how Male units are so few & nothing special compare to Female units. Sadge",2,2024-06-22 15:43:28

I have a story... Since the moment of their creation I have held distaste and sworn I would NEVER play a gacha game. And have maintained that path all these years. I got mistplay last week to make some money from gaming. Yesterday I only because I was making money off playing I said I would TRY H: S R. Minutes in and I'm feeling curiousity and intrigue to the mysterious events that are the intro. And just like that I'm enjoying the sights and sounds and characters.

Also, y'all's need to add more chibis, I need to keep going on my roll of the chibi collector of hoyoverse. Also, for both games, PLEASE ADD A BOY CHIBI, FOR CRYING. OUT. LOUDD...

"This is my first hyv game and I'm very addicted to it. I'm not too good at open world explorations so I really love this. The angst are all so good to the point they made me kinda hate hyv for it, but that means they're doing a very good job! The development is good too and we're certainly progressing in the main point of the story. Overall, this is very good imo it's literally my first hyv game and it's my standard now. Here's hoping my storage could handle the updates!",5,2024-06-21 12:20:39

"the game is really good, let me explain. HSR has really good plot, especially the penacony part, it was peak. There are a lot of ways to obtain rewards needed in order to obtain characters (gacha), like exploration, amazing quests and events - which you can also access as a new player. There is a lot to do, even if you are late player, and the game overall is fun to play. Mc (us) is super funny and chaotic. Its really a great game",5,2024-06-21 05:47:24

"I love this game. I've been playing it for a few months now. The story and the artwork is awesome. But has one huge flaw. I want to play it on ps5 but it won't let me sync my psn with my current mobile star rail account. I have no intention of starting all over. If I cannot successfully transfer my mobile hoyoverse that's synced with my Google to ps5 by syncing psn then I won't play it on ps5. It's a bummer. review would be 5 stars if they let us sync It through psn app, and the actual console",2,2024-06-21 04:11:17
Honestly the one of only issues is that jumping is not possible which is sad BUT the game gives very nice experience and story that is full of plot twists. Although at the start of the game the plot in Hertas space station and Belebog isn't the best and this places aren't really fun to explore (which is only my opinion). Still the story there here is good enough to give good experience and the game is worth a shot. Another issue is storage - a lot of people donnt have enough storage to play.,5,2024-06-21 04:03:25

Look I love this game, the story and combat are all so good but my god I just can't keep playing when it takes up that much storage. Can't you guys optimize it like you did with genshin? In genshin we have the option to delete past resources can't that be implemented here too?",1,2024-06-20 14:09:49

The game so far is amazing! And the story is so good! I just have one problem and it's the storage... It's too much for phone users and the last update was way too much like- it went from 21 gb to 30+gb??? I deleted everything and still can't finish the update. My opinion is to make phone users choose the quality they want to make the data less. Thank you for reading!,5,2024-06-20 13:13:54

The combat is turn-based which is not my favorite but the game made it look so cool! Although it will get repetitive after a while. The story is the strong part of this game in my opinion. Every planet looks so unique with different puzzles and chests. My biggest complain is about character balance which is not ok at all. Edit: it still has powercreep issue to this day. Every new character is way better than the previous one which pushes players into spending more on the game...,4,2024-06-19 19:54:28

This game absolutely sucks outside of it's story to get good characters you need crystals. Which you can get within the game easy right no. You can farm your whole day away to get enough pulls for a 5star just to lose your 50/50 it put you in a bad mood after all them hrs just for your hard work to be trash or you can take the money route which gives you only 25 to 28 spins for 50$ and for 100$ its 44 the prices are way to high for what where getting just to lose are 50/50.,1,2024-06-19 10:27:22

Amazing turn base RPG. Probably the best mobile game I've played in years. The character design and skills are all unique that it creates for a diverse game play. The storyline is very rich and engaging with many different puzzles during the adventure.,5,2024-06-19 09:29:53
"hsr is nice, the character stories and designs r amazing. and graphics are amazing. At first the battle style felt clunky but I got used to it. honkai star rail feel like fresh air after playing genshin tbh. BUT HOYO PLS MAKE SUNDAY PLAYABLE🙏",5,2024-06-19 09:27:52
Well early stage I kind resist on playing this . But longer I involve I found out it's fun to play. Thank you developers for create this game to enlighten my spare time.,5,2024-06-19 09:25:49
space train game very epic,5,2024-06-19 09:23:48
13GB update 2.3 it sucks as devs should provide features to delete past quests. Its already 35 GB in total for android. I m gonna quit if it extends more than that. HSR devs pls listen mobile players.,5,2024-06-19 09:21:10

"Super super fun! I love the characters and even though I've usually opted to auto mode for most of my other turn based games, the animations and gameplay feels engaging and fun to play manually as well! The story is solid for the first place, gets shaky in the next stop but don't worry because it's only for a bit- the third place (penacony) is AWESOME and a blast, the story is so good, seriously.",5,2024-06-19 08:46:35
"The dialogues in game most time are funny but the game isn't shy with giving us more deeper topics, The rewards are pretty good too they did give us a free five star though it isn't available anymore they might do it again in the future, the five star they gave isn't sloppy at all and does great damage and even then the free four stars they give are pretty decent too you can really do alright I'm the game without pulling for characters so much.",5,2024-06-19 08:45:21
"This game is really fun. Its Genshin impact but turn based battles. Gorgeous graphics and a great story. Also, the boss battles at the end of chapters are jaw-dropping.",5,2024-06-19 08:45:18

The only thing is that I had to uninstall because it got too big for my device. The constant updates for everything ended up eating too much storage on my device.

Absolutely love this game and I love how it's connected to the other games as well. Hoyoverse is really good at making multiverse games and I really enjoy it. The story and everything is really cool. Though I don't like the combat system. I prefer an open world combat system but it's okay I guess. I look forward to the updates.,5,2024-06-19 08:16:24

"This is a fantastic RPG, that is unfortunately F2P, and absolutely is held back by its monetization. The Gacha Pulls are laughably expensive, the droprates are pathetic, and the trashy mobile mechanics like Energy suck. Also the arbitrary fps lock to 60 on Non-Apple Products is scummy at best. This includes even the PC version. There is no reason why we consumers should not have this feature, making scumbag design choices because a company paid you is awful for your game quality.",3,2024-06-19 08:05:35

"If you remember the Muppet Show, say it with me: ""Trains in S-P-A-A-A-C-E!"" The art is gorgeous. The main combat is turn-based (great for people like me who don't do well w/ quadruple bucky button mashers. There are different play modes beside combat. Lots of depth to the content, including associated media. Yes, it's a gacha. No whaling required, although I do support w/ monthly supply pass.

"Im not really into gacha games, and especially here the prices are extortionate, but you can pretty much ignore them and just play F2P. And honestly, it is a genuinely good game with cool characters and (mostly) great writing. Full disclosure, I did eventually put some money into the ""Express pass"" about 60 quid total after a full year of playing pretty much every day, and Ive paid that much for far worse games that did not entertain me for as long, so Id say they've more than earned it.",5,2024-06-19 06:08:38

"Decent game overall. Beautiful character and map design. Good story and music. However, progression resources are very limited for me starting at level 50+, and as a turn based game, there isn't too much to do. However though, the story makes up the lack of gameplay. I can't describe how I much I love the story, the characters, the art, the music. Even if the story is somewhat long, it is fun and interesting enough to keep you engaged over and over and not get bored, unlike some other games.",5,2024-06-19 02:00:33

too much endgame that needs meta characters. too much content. events are getting annoying with the amount of dialogues and unnecessary stuff to do. just add a skip button already.,3,2024-06-18 14:00:19

"Love this game, it's just always a lot to do. I don't mind taking my time getting through a game, but if you do mind going slow this game might give you issue. It takes a lot of time to build good characters. It's easier to build a good character here than in Genshin though, imo (love both).",5,2024-06-18 12:29:46
"Not much to say, gameplay, QOL update every single patch, great character/ui design. But there's a big problem with the turn based which cannot be fixed. The power creep on new characters.",5,2024-06-18 12:26:23

"everything in this rating is just my personal gripes with the game. why is the story quest sunday boss ridiculously overpowered and hard to beat? sure, i like a good challenge every now and again, but it's not even fun. it's actually frustrating. if he doesn't nuke my dps, i'm still spending hours trying to break the sheild that keeps refreshing. still, maybe it's just a skill issue on my part. but i can't properly build my boothill because the echo of war trace materials are locked.",3,2024-06-18 11:01:36
"The game design is really cool and the characters too. The gameplay is really comfortable for me, I'm playing Genshin Impact and there is the difference between these two games. Instead of normal combat fighting like in Genshin Impact, the characters have they own turn and the enemies also have their turns. For me, this game is relaxation.",5,2024-06-18 11:01:08
13GB update ??? Really dude memori internal sisa 15GB suruh update game 13GB ngeri,2,2024-06-18 10:11:16
"The story is amazing. Character designs and building are phenomenal , same with the music and graphics. Combat is incredibly fun and does require some actual thought and planning as well. Three things, though. One, hoyo, can I please win a 50/50 in any game. Two, I needed more Dan heng in penacony. Three, can I stop getting bronya on every banner? It's getting tedious. And I'm going to end this on, Imbibitor Lunae, Dan heng, or Gepard. Please marry me.",5,2024-06-18 09:59:51
"Best: Nice and balance battle mechanic. The upgrade system is great and feel rewarding, require some effort to grind and the game provides facilities to navigate to the upgrade materials easily. Enemies toughness curve is consistent, as long as we power up the characters. Work well with phone (although low poly but look nice). Ok: Story, but the concept of travel universe-to-universe by space train and factions are interesting. Cons: Some dialogues are too long (Herta's memories, etc.).",5,2024-06-18 08:47:43
"It's an very amazing game especially the enemies and characters, and the amount of rewards we get is even more amazing (genshin could never) , so far I love this game.

"It takes a min to play the game... Not so much slow download time, but I think it's all the update files. Takes a min But the reason I have given a two star is because I've tried twice now at the very beginning, after the initial attack the first time you open your data pad it kicks me out... So I can't play it. Has anyone else had this problem and is there a quick fix so I can play the game . Thanks so much an advance for any help I can get!!!",2,2024-06-18 01:10:08

"It's a very great game. Great sound design, graphics, animations, well designed character etc. I am giving 4 stars because I want a option called ""skip"".

"Honkai StarRail is like hopping on a cosmic rollercoaster piloted by an overly caffeinated space hamster. The plot twists harder than a pretzel at a carnival, and the characters are so quirky they could form their own sitcom. The battles? Think of laser light shows crossed with a fever dream. It's chaotic, hilarious, and somehow still makes sense—just don't ask me how!",5,2024-06-16 17:42:44

"The game is already good based on story, grapich and else. But major problem is iquilibrium level can't be downgrade or lower. Now with lv 66, i can't progress version 2.2 boss because it so strong for my character. Basicly free to play player and who just play to enjoy game is struggle to progres story just because boss level is too high for us to handle.",3,2024-06-16 16:18:47
"Why is it so hard to even get and collect 4 star light cone and character? The game treasures them as if they are limited 5 star. In addition, limited 5 star is difficult to get which I don't mind, but 4 star should be at least easily obtainable and max out as they are being handicapped, this game makes me feel like a handicapped person, the developer gives you a character that is being handicapped intentionally and ask you to pay so that you can enough chance to cure the handicapness.",1,2024-06-16 14:16:14

It's a really fun game with great characters and I still don't fully understand the story but I have fun just running around I don't have a PC or console so getting to play a game like this on my phone it's kinda hard to find the tools you need to level up and increase your characters and companions power so defeating major big bad bosses takes forever cause you gotta constantly retreat and revive your characters plus constantly changing the people on my team besides that the games fun to play,4,2024-06-16 11:26:13

"Largely, it's a great game, but the energy system could use an overhaul. 6 minutes to recover one energy with a max of 240, then 18 minutes to recover a single point in the backup reserve. If it's going to take that long, it would make more sense to recover a few energy in the main pool every six minutes and 5-10 energy per 18 minutes in the reserve. Makes it rather difficult and slow to farm Trace materials and relics.",4,2024-06-16 04:54:12

This game wouldn't have survived if it wasn't a hoyo game. There's no justifiable means for the power creep this game has like pvp. The devs need to take a note from the other turned based games and give ways to bring characters up to the power level to be usable in new content that isn't making a new meta. Topaz and Ratio was brought back because of 2 new characters running back to back that catered to them. There is also a lack of 4 stars making it less desirable to pull from having them maxed,3,2024-06-12 11:34:14

"A breath of fresh air among the rising open-world genres of gacha games! While most of the time I usually get bored of turn-based gameplay, Star rail did not have that problem! Moreover, it did a great job in character design and personality! No kidding I'm invested to each one lol. But, its highlight has got to be its story! At first it started out pretty decent throughout the Luofu Arc, but when Penacony arrived it reached PEAK LEVELS of pacing, originality, and story! Looking forward to it!",5,2024-06-11 15:49:34

"Probably my favorite game at the moment, definitely tops every other gacha game. This game is quite generous with the free pulls and rewards it offers. I don't say this lightly - the game's story and world are truly immersive + characters are awesome. I quit briefly about two months after the game's launch because farming materials grew awfully tedious, but once your team is sufficiently geared, you can just put it all on autoplay. Above all, this game does not require a massive time commitment!",5,2024-06-09 01:01:16
This game is super polished and the characters are great. The combat is just ok. You can auto through most of it and getting more powerful is mostly locked behind RNG equipment. I would be good with all of this but the story is SO FULL of useless uninteresting unskipable filler I just can't continue.,3,2024-06-09 00:45:57
"It's really good but they managed to make the gear grind every bit as frustrating as genshin. As such, I end up having to take extended breaks(like weeks) from playing the game for my sanity. Please let us reroll sub stats, for the love of god",4,2024-06-08 23:08:39

"Stop shoving Caelus everywhere. I don't want to play this game if MHY does the same thing they did with Aether. You have a diverse player base, stop trying to make male MC canon. Oh, and your Firefly favouritism is showing, tuck it back in. No myriad celestia for male characters, despite many deserving one, like Boothill and Aventurine. I'm disappointed that a multimillionaire company only caters to half of their player base.",1,2024-06-08 22:04:02

This game changed my life,5,2024-06-08 04:28:53
Game is really fun until you start fighting enemies that can divide or call for reinforcements and for some reason the developers let the game balance can go out the window for example in the Space Station you will fight these Hercules beetles battle starts off 4:3 by the time they get done calling for reinforcements and dividing it's more like four verses 8 which really becomes annoying,1,2024-06-08 02:49:42

The story, especially Penacony, satisfied me, unlike genshin that slowly deteriorating, HSR gave me a good storyline. Keep it up devs !

"Este é com certeza o melhor jogo da Hoyoverse. A história é boa, os personagens são lindos, as animações impecáveis, a gameplay sensacional, as recompensas são muitas. Honkai realmente é um ótimo jogo. As vezes você fica preso em uma batalha e não consegue sair dela, pois o boss é muito forte. Mas melhorar seus personagens e subir o nível de desbravamento é muito fácil, fazendo você ficar mais forte. Os eventos são muito divertidos, além de que você ganha gemas por qualquer ação.",5,2024-06-07 10:52:48

You can tell so much thought and world building is taking place in each update. The quests can get a little tedious, so events are a good break. The gacha system is also my favorite!

"Love the character designs and story. It is also a good detail to have a description about everything thats happening (my favourite being the description of the aeons/gods that are in this game). The developers are also very generous. If you prefer games that require less travelling and more combat and lore, this game is for you. I also enjoy the streams that they run, its always very comedic and funny. I also love the theme songs that they have in the game, especially in Penaconys dreamscape.",5,2024-06-03 19:09:19
"one of the best games i've played. well-designed characters, really good writing most of the time, decent combat system too. unlike that other mihoyo game, there is actually some things that are fun to do even after you max out on levels. overall, it's great, and i would recommend playing hsr unless you are a massive hater of the turn-based combat, or if you are afraid of wasting all your life savings on characters (which you really don't even need to do).",5,2024-06-03 16:05:15
Plsssss let it be available on ps4 plssss,5,2024-06-03 11:55:48
"The graphics are gorgeous, the gameplay isn't overly difficult, I absolutely love the voice overs. The only thing that I would ever want from the game is a personal room available to customize for players, like the housing system of genshin impact, but smaller.",5,2024-06-03 11:36:04
Just give me limited 5 stars (give me lucky RNG) and I'm good 😁,5,2024-06-03 10:40:33
When I play this game for the very first time it's always glitching a bit a was going a bit further to silver wolf when I went in the phone to see a red dot I went in and then any I get out of the game I use an Google pixel 8 can the editor explain it to what's wrong with the game when I playing on my Google pixel 8.,3,2024-06-03 08:27:53

Over all its an a good game and highly suggested. My only problem is im having trouble in grinding echoes and playing at all because my device keep crashing every minute or seconds. My device can handle highest graphics smoothly but for random reason it keeps crashing.,5,2024-06-03 05:36:47

"Edited: It can definitely be frustrating when summoning new units requires a lot of resources, especially for free-to-play players. Game developers should often balance the need for revenue with providing enjoyable experiences for all players. Offering occasional free summons or events can help alleviate some of the pressure for free-to-play players.",1,2024-06-03 03:33:24

"Mihoyo continues to impress. A fantastic game that boasts exceptional quality across the board, and has become a trend-setter to influence all new and future turn-based (and other) games. The game mainly suffers from horrible cutscene lag that doesn't have an easy (or in my case, any) fix, and increasingly rampant power-creep with each new character - with each new character being as strong or stronger than the last, the new content becomes more challenging (for better and for worse). 9.5/10",5,2024-06-02 17:37:03

"This is a very beautiful and detailed game, the graphics are awesome there is alot to the story of the game, every world that you go into is pretty cool but there are some things i dont like about this game that maybe you guys can change in the future, i dont like how the main character that is supposed to be you is so plain looking and there is no way to change her hair or clothes, i prefer running around the game as one of my other characters rather then the holder of the stellaron..",4,2024-06-02 15:50:16
Amazing game,5,2024-06-02 15:01:00
"I love boothill. The quality is amazing and the story is just peak perfection. I also love how they treat their players, and how much plot there is to a single moment. The character designs are also amazing and their background stories are all *chefs kiss*. 10/10, would love to play for the first time again. I ALSO WON MH 50/50!!",5,2024-06-02 14:06:03
"This game is amazing,but like any hoyoverse game on an OPPO 16S, it is unplayable and laggy but i have seen many gameplays of this game and i cant blame the devs for my choice of device and it deserves a 5 star or 4 star at the least. I can't play anymore because the texture glitches and dissapears, the whole experience is laggy after the new updates and the game was way more normal in the pre-register version. Sadly,the lag makes me unable to play the game but i can watch videos of the storyig",5,2024-06-02 13:49:37
One of your open world game destroyed my harddrive so for me to continue to play that game I install it in my mobile even thou I need to play it in low graphics setting and as for this one I wanted to reinstall it in my phone but what it said not compatible to my device? How come back then I can install it 😞 the game it self is good ah what a let down.,2,2024-06-02 12:51:14
"Ost, graphics, voice acting, story, lore, gameplay, character building, everything about this game is 5 star worthy. The gacha aspect might be worrisome to some, but you can easily finish the main story quests with the free characters the game provides you with, not to mention the game is F2P friendly anyways, saving up for characters is easy since the game is quite generous with rewards and events, and the quality of life this game has is superb, there is an auto battle feature for farming!",5,2024-06-02 11:46:03

"I took a break from playing because I didn't have any new characters I wanted to build because Im saving for a character. The only reason I have to play this game is the story and the characters, which I do like, but the gameplay doesn't really pull me in until there's something new to do",4,2024-06-02 05:31:57

"The game's graphics is pretty good, rewards are very good from events (alot), they even give rewards and free 5-star hero directly from the game's email, really good story and lores from characters, every map and worlds are pretty good too. This is a must play, unlike genshin, atleast this one is not as laggy as genshin. My problems: some events are hard to clear like pure fiction because I need characters that deals lot of damage and also relics are hard to level up because it's scarce..",5,2024-06-01 16:19:05
"This game is very easy to play and control, even on mobile. You don't even need a controller since it's turn-based. The characters, especially the Trailblazer (or Trollblazer) are lovely, expressive and have their own unique quirks and personalities compared to Genshin's roster. This game rewards you very generously with events and doesn't get boring with any content. Though, the enemy designs could use some change. They reuse the same base models for a lot of non-boss enemies.",5,2024-06-01 15:49:34

"SUCH good writing in Penacony. Loved every bit of it, down to each minor side quest. Music is fantastic, story is incredibly cerebral, and visuals are amazing. HSR toes the line between more mature story concepts while retaining an upbeat adventurous spirit to it. Heart-rending and impactful story beats. Each map is a pleasure to explore. Pull rates are good compared to some other gachas, and each update feels very rewarding. :)",5,2024-06-01 12:01:54
"This game has strategic game and original songs. It also has lovable characters and plot storyline on the way. It's sure fun to play because there will have new events and characters! One thing that I want this game to add but I am sure it will not add, it is... Jump button, I really love jump button tbh, but the concept of the game doesn't have but it's okay.

I started playing this since January and have not skipped a day. I am obsessed with all the characters their personalities and the world and the story. Peakony really delivered. But after finishing 2.2 I woke up to find I'm logged out and I can't log in since then. I am really worried about it. I wish to get some info or help from the devs. I love this game and can't lose it yet. And all the characters I've built I can't lose them too. It's been frustrating,5,2024-05-31 13:25:39

"It is crazy the world we live in today. Honkai Star Rail is worse than a final fantasy rpg in terms of story and appearance, and yet Star Rail is seen more valuable merely because of advertisements, the cost, and mobile phone compatibility.

"This is one of my favorite games to play. I find the character designs and personality amazing. I love the combat style too even if I know it's not for everyone. The story is interesting and quick enough that I don't get bored of the story. It is a grind heavy game if you want to maximize the DMG output your characters can have. I have fun building my characters and maximizing their DMG...I somehow turned my Aventurine into a DPS because of this. It's a very f2p game, go for characters you like.",5,2024-05-30 01:18:26
"Boring gameplay. Things get little interesting with Aventurine but soon die down. The falling bs with 2 siblings is cringe af cuz it reassembles HI3. Almost every ending has this (Hi3). This game makes me think it's a spin-off of HI. As soon as Acheron said she was Raiden Mei, I deleted the game. Just, I get you want to attract HI kanchou but pls, I have enough. Instead of making it interesting, u only show ur lack of creativity. Utterly disappointed as dayone kanchou/trailblazer",2,2024-05-30 01:11:26

"It is a good game, but my gacha luck is horrible in it. Every 5* took me 70+ pulls. When I lost the 50-50 for Fu Xuan at 75 pity, it was the final straw. I had originally started playing because it gave more pulls then Genshin every patch, but I don't see any difference with its abysmal drop rates. There are also times when it crashes before starting. As this all coincided with WuWa launch and I got some good pulls there, HSR is the one to go.",3,2024-05-29 22:29:39

"The combat where you can set it on automatic battle mode is definitely what I am looking for as you can do different things while you are playing.

"Lore is actually nice. Specifically came here for the men, and pulls are doing fine. Fave part of the game is how generous they are with Stella jades and how kind they are with giving a free 5 star character at their 1st anniversary! Absolutely loving the game, I have been an ar70 for just a few months and have been gaining lots of 5 star characters. Love the fandom, admin, and the game itself.

should add a jump button it'll make the game better,4,2024-05-29 08:31:17
"It's really great. Very generous free 10 wishes per new banner. Really easy to farm for Jades. Aventurine boss fight is all RNG so just hope you have good luck and I recommend bringing AOE characters so you have a higher chance of living in the boss fight, But the 2nd Phase you can only use those who went above the specified number so really bring AOE characters. Overall great game, I don't recommend doing Trailblaze 65 Ascension quest it will make you story bosses harder. Tho my ARTIFACT LUCK⬇️",5,2024-05-29 08:26:53

Too expensive and money hungry. everytime i gacha it's always pity (80 draw). I don't know why people always posted that is easy to get 5 star character but i didn't experienced that. Thinking of uninstall it now.,1,2024-05-29 07:31:41

"Amazing story, great graphics. Would 100% recommend trying it out.",5,2024-05-29 01:12:24
"the game itself is great. art style, characters, music, references, lore and much more. the reason why i rated 4 star is because there's a problem with the log in loading that turns into black screen for 2-3 minutes (or more) and just background music playing. i hope this gets fixed because i find it irritating. -thanks",3,2024-05-28 23:56:04
"Very difficult to play on the cellphone. Takes a long time to load everything e begin to play. I tried a few times, but without success. I gave up and deleted it.",1,2024-05-28 23:37:26
"A fun experience over all! The story line is amazing, the visuals and music are splendid and the characters are dynamic. It all comes together beautifully! My only qualms are that with every update the game is becoming a problem for my phone's storage, and unfortunately most cutscenes lag and buffer a lot which hinders the audio-visual and emotional aspect of said scene. [This has been a problem since launch on android devices] Hopefully this problem gets resolved in the next patch or so.",5,2024-05-28 23:14:47

I love everything about this game. It can make me feel excited and emotional at the same time. Beautiful story telling with beautifully designed characters. The gameplay is fun and very easy to understand but also requires you to strategize your next step which adds up to the enjoyment of the game. I really love this game.,5,2024-05-28 15:17:00
Blatant favoritism. They'll ignore some characters and only focus on the popular units during beta. They'll nerf anything that helps older units in favor of the new popular one. And they seem to have an agenda against male units.,1,2024-05-28 14:52:14

"It's a good game however trailblaze power (energy system) which every damn gacha game has is ridiculous cuz it takes forever to build characters. wish u could just make it that enemy would drop material not with energy but with actuall fighting and grinding. it's not fun man, it's just not fun anymore. I used to love the game but now it's just not fun anymore. Now i just log on do daily quests and log out cant play the game cuz i have no energy. Sry for not spending money i guess.

"This game is one of my absolute favorites. There is always tons of content and new characters with beautiful designs. If you love games with missions or quests directing your gameplay like I do, then this is the game for you.

The characters are a mix of endearing and exasperating, like that friend who always insists on pineapple pizza.

The story and the characters are amazing. Even the gacha and quest systems feel more polished and more rewarding than other games. I had just one problem: Some of the battles are really difficult and it sometimes feels like the game locks new progress behind meta characters which you have to pull for. Which was not a problem when the game was released but now it is because more and more characters are being added. The game needs a world level lowering mechanic!!!,4,2024-05-27 06:15:34

"As of 05/26/2024: I've played since Day 1, and I'm still playing. The #1 reason I continue to play HSR is that it respects your time. Dailies are short, farming is mostly automated, dailies are quick, events last a long time and most are completely released on the first day. The ""end game"" content is optional. And MiHoYo gives a lot of free pulls in HSR! Downsides: I'm a female player. HSR men are not the best. Could do better.",4,2024-05-27 03:29:49

"started playing after 3 months of its release. unlike other games it's still pretty generous with rewards and jades. really easy to farm (but good relic stats all depends on how good your luck is, istg i can cry- TwT) and the puzzles are entertaining, collecting characters is easier than genshin. and animations are just perfect. only takes 22gb in my phone. so it's manageable. no lag and no bugs (probably those def stats r bugs-) Yet worth downloading so go ahead 🫶",5,2024-05-26 21:41:05

The gatcha side of things is fun although stressful as you might miss characters but everything else is a 10/10 with lots to do and a great emphasis on solo game play,5,2024-05-26 11:06:30
"Barely into it, still in tutorial, but game crashes constantly on a Samsung S23, which normally runs games far more detailed than this Gameplay atm seems fun, when it runs... will edit review when/if I can get further into game",3,2024-05-26 10:12:10

"VERY grind heavy game. It gets 2 stars because of the good story, fun characters, and cool worlds, but 99% of your play time is just fighting the same enemies over and over again for materials/currency. The power creep is also significant, which means it's a never-ending race to grind enough to level up the newest characters to be able to clear anything. If you play for story, characters, lore, or exploration, that gets annoying real fast. But if you play to fight, you'll enjoy it.",2,2024-05-26 07:59:22
"I love this game. Great graphics, characters and story. The only thing I have a issue with is the amount of storage this game takes up. I have 128 GB of storage on my phone, yet I'm still worried about how much space HSR takes up. Every update the amount of storage needed increases, and I really want to keep on playing. If it gets to a point where I need to start deleting things to play, I might just delete Honkai. I'm sure there's some way to lower or delete unneeded storage.",2,2024-05-26 07:21:18

"The battle systrm is horrendous. Genuinely can't progress past Aventurine's boss. Takes too much time and I die before I even finish the second or first round. The bosses just keep getting harder, even though I am on level. Not to mention the fact that the story either takes forever or is too quick. There's barely any redeeming qualities for this game anymore- I'll stick with lore summaries, thanks.",1,2024-05-26 03:24:44

"there are two types of people when playing an story games, first is those who enjoy the game and the second one is those who just casually want to enjoy the game such as gacha and farming, so it is really annoying when the player are force to listen to the story which it is ""UNSKIPABLE"" so it just get tiring trying to skip the story by pressing the dialog multiple time, I hope in the next patch the developers can follow ""Wuthering Wave"" footstep in including the skip story button",3,2024-05-25 22:34:01

"CS ignored my feedback so I'll make it public. Drop rates have become ridiculously low for me in this game both in the gacha and in farming materials. 50/50 is more like 20/80; You spend day after day farming for ""relics"" which often have random chances of rolling good stats. I've spent the last two months and have maybe only 1 relic out of thousands that has nice stats, when each character needs 6... Just about done trying with this game. Incredibly demotivating.",2,2024-05-25 10:19:20

"Turn-based combat is widely regarded as a genre that emphasizes strategic gameplay. However, HSR's combat system appears to be limited to basic attacks, skills, and ultimate abilities. Furthermore, the strategic depth of the game seems to be heavily reliant on character abilities, which are obtained through gacha mechanics. This approach may limit the player's ability to develop and execute diverse strategies, as they may be restricted by the characters they have acquired.",2,2024-05-24 15:03:04

"At first I thought this turn-base rpg game it would be a boring after 2-3 days playing time, but recently I have experienced this HSR for more than a week it always comes with a new things along with the story goes.

"To compare star rail to genshin, while I enjoy genshin as a game more but hsr is a lot easier to play, easier to stick to, genshin takes 10x more time to farm, do daily quests, earn resources.. hsr has everything handed to you, the game is WAY more optimized, the developers try way more, they actually consider player feedback, they actually bring meaningful UI changes... i dont like the characters/story as much as I do in genshin but as far as the gaming aspect goes hsr is way better.",4,2024-05-24 13:56:48

And it's really annoying to delete all the data and download them all again, and today it happened again! Please fix this!!",5,2024-05-24 12:56:10
"I've been into hsr since before it released. I watched a trailer with Bailu in it and immediately wanted to get her. I've been continuously surprised by the quality and standard of this game. I had tried Hoyo's other games (hi3 and Genshin) and wasn't into them, but hsr is quite different. I love the way it plays, the storylines, and the characters so much.

Story of the game and quality is great but seriously what is friends list used for when we can't play together??! please solve this problem in new patch,4,2024-05-23 01:23:24
It can get boring but it's amazing so do try it but the play style is turn base so it's up to you if you like it,4,2024-05-23 01:08:11
Just not my thing personally,1,2024-05-23 00:59:40
its good for grinding,5,2024-05-22 23:48:04
the whole penacony story quest is almost an entire ff series in the early 20s. I'm satisfied 5*,5,2024-05-22 23:30:38
"Turn Based RPG done right. Super fun combat, with an action packed story. And you actually have to use your brains to strategize the matches to win. Highly recommended",5,2024-05-22 23:20:58
"The story is fantastic and entertaining, the characters are interesting, and it seems like in this game feedback is ACTUALLY heard and QoL changes are made to improve the game. Really love that this doesn't fall into the pitfall that many gacha games do where it's too much of a chore to be f2p and to level characters. It's a good balance that actually keeps the game enjoyable. The music and the storytelling especially in the latest chapter are fantastic; I'm excited to see what comes next!",5,2024-05-22 23:16:47

"it's a really good game !! i've played hsr since march of 2024, and safe to say i've enjoyed it a lot ! but there are some times that i can't progress through the story, but i believe it's just because i need to get stronger characters or need better strategy ! and there's often times that i can't do much because i did all the quests 😞",4,2024-05-22 22:16:40
"After finishing genshin for the story I realized there was nothing left to do so I heard a bunch of my friends talking about honkai: star rail, so I decided to try it out. The story was the best I have ever seen penacony was peek and I couldn't believe that they were made by the same company free 10 pulls every patch, free 5 star (Dr ratio), actually decent anniversary, almost no dry patches (I believe we only had 2 or 3 in the entire game), and multiple versions of endgame content.",5,2024-05-22 22:07:23

PERSOOONAAAAAA,5,2024-05-22 20:03:10
It's a good game that deserves 5 star in every aspect minus the power balancing between the characters and blatant favorism towards the female characters that discourages me from playing.,1,2024-05-22 20:00:47

I really want to like this game but as a casual player that has barely anytime to grind they really did the best to make it more miserable by making bosses even harder,3,2024-05-22 16:55:05
Hey HOYOVERSE team can we get a ANIME adaptation of the story for the game it's so good and also content is so good 👍😊 also want GENSHIN IMPACT anime adaptation,5,2024-05-22 16:25:26
"They add some few things like in boss fight most player are struggling for how hard a boss is like Aventurine, Sam, etc. They should add something like you can use other people's character for support or players can fight them in low like genshin impact.",3,2024-05-22 15:37:33

"Gameplay is good , only problem I have with is relics , never get good artifacts, rng sucks",1,2024-05-22 13:00:09
I love this app. Although the resources take a while to load. So I just got to play the tutorial. But I love the characters especially Kafka and Den Hang. I have one request tho please make the resources loading screen faster.,5,2024-05-22 12:52:51
"Its a great game don't get me wrong like the graphics stunning, the game play is amazing, the story is fantastic but my only issue is the storage and the battery drain like many other hoyoverse games it takes so much storage and I can't play that many other games that I would love to play like genshin impact or Honkai impact but I can't really have more than one of these games at a time because of the amount of storage they take up. But other than that it is an amazingly beautiful game.",3,2024-05-22 12:07:40
Love this game,5,2024-05-22 11:58:10
"Good, but I do have a simple issue. Why the f*** wrong with your side quest?! It's too long even longer than the character quests! It took me 45min just to complete a side quest that give absolutely 30 jades! And some exp",4,2024-05-22 11:21:55

Love the game. This game is a little generous than the other one (GI),4,2024-05-22 11:14:51
"I played genshin before, then Honkai, and i prefer honkai more as dailies doesnt take time, which make this game more enjoyable. Characters, stories, visual, locations and areas are interesting, overall has no complaint",5,2024-05-22 11:09:18
"I love this game, but Hoyo is disappointing me over and over again with the waifu favoritism. They always purposely buff the female characters either directly or indirectly with relic sets tailored specifically for their female characters. While the male characters are always with kits that have a mechanic that requires support. And guess what, most of the supports/buffers are female characters. It has been a year, but no limited 5 star male harmony character AT ALL. Very disappointed.",1,2024-05-22 10:33:37
"Characters are power crept way too fast. Today's best is tomorrow's second, third and so on. Too much pressure to pull for new characters. Can't keep up.",2,2024-05-22 10:13:56
Only issue with me is story is little to complicated and smtimes that could just make me clueless and I don't feel involved at all in the story so i hope so u work on stories a little bit everything else A+,4,2024-05-22 10:12:25
"Doing favouritism 8 days before banner, good tactics",1,2024-05-22 09:51:35
"Much better than Genshin Impact because it respects the players' time more. You can auto battle any fight if you're feeling lazy, except certain storyline or boss fights. Farming leveling materials is very easy and quick. Farming gear is still the downside of things, BUT you don't have to worry too much about getting the perfect gear IF you keep your world level low. For casual players I would recommend only going to world 3 or 4, after that you do need to be picky about your gear, teams.",4,2024-05-22 09:16:00
good 👍,5,2024-05-22 08:50:58
"As a battle enjoyer player, Sunday arc is a living hell. Too long story and dialogue, it kills my mood to play and grinding. And whoever give Robin a single song for the Ultimate is also deserve a smack from players. Others might find it good in story, but for me is just making me sure to not play it more often.",2,2024-05-22 08:31:11
I like it it's just that it's too slow to load and like it takes forever even if you have enough space for the game to download and every time I keep downloading the resources it keeps making me do it again and again and again no matter what I do so if this could be fixed that would be great and I really wish that when it loads it speeds up not slow these could be fixed this would be amazing thank you.,2,2024-05-22 08:24:28
Feels like i'm reading a whole novel which makes me feel dizzy,4,2024-05-22 08:12:48
"Used to love the game... Was looking forward & patiently waiting for great male harmony units. But after the favouritism kept on showing, made me down & not looking forward to anything anymore. I don't think HSR will balance things out for Male Characters collectors, not in the future too.. They want to make second HI3 on HSR...",1,2024-05-22 07:19:25

"I am deeply disappointed with the recent update of the game. The developers have made significant changes to one of the characters, which has negatively impacted my gaming experience. It's disappointing to see them catering to certain segments of their fanbase while disregarding the preferences of others. As a result, this update leaves me feeling frustrated and unsatisfied with the overall direction of the game",1,2024-05-22 01:32:01

"Game has very good story ,world's, design, characters pretty nice, but when is about combat is pretty hard to win in game becouse all most every boss are hitting so hard and barely beat them, even tranquilizer 3 is so hard to do,rewarding in items are so hard to get something good. So im done to do something else in game no reason to try so hard when every rewards are so bad in exchange, Also on phone is working bad and lagging alot.",1,2024-05-21 23:28:22

Ive been playing since release literally day 1 and im not gonna lie this game is genuinely just perfect. It has everything going from an insane and unique combat system to the character and enemy design now dont even get me started on the fact about the ultimate every single one is a complete masterpiece and i would definitely recommend yall playing this game you have seen it really trust me just download it play it for 3 days and see how you feel.

"I want to rate this game higher. I've been playing Hoyoverse's games for years and im aware of the issues the games have. But this one is by far the most annoying and only affects Honkai: Star Rail??? Random times whenever I open the game the volume never works. My in game volume is all the way up, my phone volume is all the way up and even my notifications settings are too. I tried resetting my phone or reinstalling star rail and it doesn't fix the issue.

"This game is great, I play it all the time and it's still fun. There is so much content and they are constantly making more.

I have never spent so much as a penny on this game and I have a few 5 stars and have had a lot of fun. 100% would recommend.",5,2024-05-20 06:06:42
"To be honest, I went into this game thinking it'd be your average fighting game. I did NOT expect to get so attached to the characters, and storyline. The graphics, effects and characters are outstandingly gorgeous, and the story is extremely well done and actually makes sense. It's impressive how they featured the battles, because of that, it's actually fun. Thank you Hoyo for yet another beautifully amazing game 💖💖",5,2024-05-20 03:24:31

Unfortunately it suffers from the same sickness as any gacha game, the amount of grinding is insufferable at the same time there's nothing much to do after a certain point. What a great paradox you need to grind but there's nothing to grind with. You should also add this to the genre of idle games for how much there's nothing to do.",3,2024-05-19 14:20:27

The devs keep adding and expanding the endgame content and Simulated Universe almost every patch. The story and lore are great, the music is excellent, and the characters are unique and interesting.

I just feel like dev care about the game, with ever update you get many quality of life improvements, like they are makeing the game easier to do dailys. The gacha is not a problem I never got the feeling like I need to spend money to get some characters with so many events and ways you can get stellar jades.

"It's a really amazing game with experimental routes from time to time with a great story and characters. It has a fun ost and a great past time game for those who are into RPG and similar concepts to final fantasy games. Though, it gets a tad bit repetitive after countless fights and my rng must really suck because I can hardly get a good relic which makes me lose interest due to frustrations and burnout.

Retyping a whole new review. Honkai: Star Rail is still a very fun and unique game that I enjoy playing very much. The graphics and art to the game is very appealing to the eye. Especially the lore within it. But it's been a good while now and I still have the same problem form the start where I can't hear any audio from the game unless it's an event from the main story quest. And then the audio just cuts back off completely. I tried everything and I really want to experience the game fully.,4,2024-05-15 13:06:57

I like the concept of this game and have been playing this game for quite awhile. I can't even by pass the new content with all maxed leveled characters with their proper set of relics. Its ridiculous on how much the powercreep is in this game. I love this game but it's making it pointless when F2P players can't even by pass new content without getting the new characters or even have good characters that are now useless to the current bosses.,2,2024-05-15 10:09:57

"Solid f2p gacha game. It's quite generous with giving out pulls and jade for gacha. The game has element of Final Fantasy vibe for exploring and turn base fighting. Game play, graphics, stories are great. There are lot of challenges to do later on. However it could get boring and redundant for farming from time to time. Also, there is no way to farm ""edilons"" unless you whales and pull hard on limited banners. At some point they should include the ""old limited banner"" into permanent banner.",5,2024-05-15 07:06:49

"By far one of (if not the) best turn based gacha games out there, especially for ppl who live in f2p. Far more interesting story than I was expecting, a player avatar that's actually very powerful at end game, free units that are actually usable, plenty of things to do that don't rely on the energy/stamina system (when you run out), amazing OST, etc. Biggest con?

The art is boring, with no diversity. You get lack melanin chars. Everyone is all handsome and beautiful, with window-chests and pale skin. Good at fanserv, tho. Their personality is not well-developed either. Repeat design, much like copy and paste. I wonder if they only hire 1 artist to do EVERYONE design or not.",1,2024-05-15 01:50:26

不想说什么，麻烦主线boss放简单点吧。我一个新手玩家，体力都缺的要死，角色也缺，要怎样打，磨了半天还是死。叫我怎样玩啊，充钱游戏。主线也这样难又不是虚构混沌。我建议要么降均衡等级，要么跟副本一样可以请支援或者剧情里面打到一半就有援助，以前刚玩原神打不过雷电将军起码还有人来帮而且是加超强的buff。这里的队友就只会看戏，真的吐血。有这样的列车队友还不如直接开门跳下去投进宇宙的怀抱算了。,1,2024-05-13 19:50:54

"Crazy how so many people think endgame content is locked to the ""new characters"". Obviously if you're F2P don't expect to get every single character (unless you're Aventurine and win every 50/50), but plan your pulls and learn to save your jades. This game is VERY F2P friendly, and is amazing for allowing you to beat content with the power of ✨️team comps✨️. Farming is also pretty chill, since you can just leave it on Auto and watch your busted Acheron friend support destroy everything.",5,2024-05-13 12:12:14

I feel like I can get to know the lore of the city and the characters relatively well. I find coming back into farming materials not very hard like some other games. Overall, just know if a desired maxed out build is wanted, it will be a challenge. So far, the artifacts are pretty good even if you don't want to max out the stats in the game. 4.8/5.0, for my opinion",5,2024-05-13 10:07:54

New boss is too hard. Needs to be nerfed badly. You really have to get a good group shielder to beat it and you're forced to use the very weak and useless Harmony Trailblazer in the Penacony story boss in place of the far better free group shielder Preservation Trailblazer. No I did not pull for Aventurine. Give us a free option.,1,2024-05-13 05:22:20

"Too much powercreep, you pull a new shiny character today they become useless in a couple of patches, the gearing system is atrocious, enough to make someone leave this game and the endgame content is designed around the new strongest DPSes, the amount of HP enemies are gaining every patch is overwhelming, you either whale to clear all content or you don't.

"Truth be told, experience's been great thus far, but that said, it has its flaws too, but it's not that major and is only based on my personal preference. Graphic-wise? It's to DIE for. The lore's a blend of mystery, yet the dialogues are quite witty. Grinding's a bit of a stretch, but nevertheless bearable. Character designs and assets are beyond creativity. And Penacony's been a wild ride; it absolutely takes the spotlight away from Jarilo and Xianzhou Arc.",4,2024-05-11 16:40:34

Been playing this game for the past few days and it's amazing. I don't really like turn base combat but this game makes it really fun in my opinion. The characters are really good and the story is interesting. It has a lot of pop culture references as well 😭😭🙏 great game,5,2024-05-11 02:56:44

Honestly idk why but this game lags a lot and load wayyyy longer than that one hoyo game that is way more complicated than star rail. But i love the rpg experience where the storyline is decided by the dialogue we choose when playing. The character and the semi open world designs are also amazing. But i don't think the game type (turn based) is really for me because it feels too monotonous.,3,2024-05-10 18:03:27

"Probably one of the best games out there for mobile. The Stories are amazing, character development and telling is perfect. The gameplay is smooth and easy to understand yet, it has a lot of depth besides just numbers. The Game is very much f2p friendly and provides many opportunities to collect and save pulls for units you'd like. The Gearing is simple yet rewarding with additional ways you can get the Relics you want. Thank you HSR team... this game is one of my favourites. <3",5,2024-05-10 03:32:23

"One of the best games I've played in years on PC or Mobile. Fantastic gameplay design and story, it just gets so much right. I'm not a huge fan of their gacha monetization but it is what it is, just go into it with the mindset of building around what you pull and not a specific character and you'll be fine. Every character I have acquired seems well designed and useful which leads to smooth progression. Huge props to everyone that was part of the development.",5,2024-05-09 23:08:32

"Finally hit pity on an event banner and didn't get the character... then found out it was a 50% chance to get the event character in a TARGETED event banner. Just left a bad taste in my mouth and registered for the account to be deleted/uninstalled. 2 stars instead of 1 because I did have a good experience with the story over the past few days, but I refuse to be a supporter of this garbage. Thank you for showing how crooked the game is early on, though!",2,2024-05-09 00:54:32
"This game is awesome!! All of the graphics, rewards, character designs and more. This has to be at least one of the BEST RPG game I have ever played in my entire life. This game is good and all but I have a complaint, When I first started playing HSR I noticed that whenever playing story mode or whenever I fight an enemy, my screen turns black and I get kicked out of the game only to be met with my home screen wallpaper. It has become more frequent when the Pencony update came out. Pls fix this❤",4,2024-05-09 00:42:48
Awesome game. Would be a 100 percent better if it had a skip button for quest storylines.,5,2024-05-09 00:26:54

5 out of 5 everything perfect just wish I can repeat the story cause it's isn't enough to see such a masterpiece once,5,2024-05-08 23:55:22
The gameplay is good but what fuels my anger is the 98% dialogues and 2% battles in every story quests. Can we just get an option to skip long dialogue cutscenes? It's too tiring to keep on just tapping your screen (when on phone)/pressing the spacebar(on pc) Some of it are okay but it's just annoying when it takes too much,1,2024-05-08 23:53:15

"Fun game and story. Love the graphics and combat system. I've been playing for months. I will say, that it takes a bit of time to upgrade certain characters when you get to a certain point. However, it took a long time for me to get to that point. Overall, I love this game and there's a lot to do in it.",5,2024-05-08 23:45:27

"No skip function. The story is like it was written by a 5 year old. But it has nice character design... too bad without a skip button, this game is just a narcissistic attempt for a 5 year old trying to force other people to see their terrible work.",1,2024-05-08 23:16:48

"Game is great. When i first installed, i played it day and night. But after you finish the main story, side stories, character stories, mini games, theres nothing to do except grinding mats. Simulated universes are fun for a while, but after a couple weeks, it gets boring. You have to wait for updates for 2 months. And the game takes up over 20Gb on your phone. That is the biggest drawback. Other than that great story, characters, and Persona-like combat",4,2024-05-08 21:47:51

I love the game and personally have played star rail genshin and honkai impact and it is just another great game. Enjoyed the story and warping for characters I love. Excellent game and can't wait for more updates,5,2024-05-08 21:16:29
Now THIS is a game worth playing! Best mobile game I have played to the point that I play it on the PC now to enjoy better graphics. Another honkai masterpiece,5,2024-05-08 21:14:59
"I adore this game so much. The graphics, the characters, the storyline. Everything. Expect 2 things. 1) Character ascension. It's tedious. It's annoying. It's boring. And then you have to level up your characters immediately afterward. Otherwise, you did all of that for nothing. 2) The Xianzhou Luofu storyline. It lacks entertainment compared to Belobog and Penacony. It's still good, don't get me wrong. But it is by far the most boring. I hope to God that we don't revisit it in the future.",5,2024-05-08 21:14:52
"genuinely one of the best games i've ever played. each character has rlly good lore, the side quests are as meaningful as the main quests and oh my god the 2.1 main quest/trailblazer quest had me in tears for a character i initially hated. i've never rlly liked turn based games but omg hsr is just genuinely so good.. the designs, the world building, the characters, the lore, the mechanics... everything is just so good and enjoyable. 10/10 !!",5,2024-05-08 20:59:42

"The world building within the game is intricate and rich. Some of the cutscenes are so well animated that you'd think it came straight out of an anime! The characters each have their own back story, both those you can play and those that are NPCs. No necessary in app purchases! My only complaint so far is that it eats a bit more of my phone's memory than I was expecting.... It's my opinion that if the game makers ever try to make an anime, it'd be one that I'd definitely watch....",4,2024-05-08 17:55:25

"Relatively nice game, however if you're not 100% up to META you fall off behind on the story. The story bosses are way to difficult for a first time fight, you also get thrown into the bosses mostly blind and they appear unexpected. For example Aventurine, this boss is way too hard for players who don't really understand or immerse themselves in the META. Don't make the bosses this hard in the story.",2,2024-05-08 16:57:21

"Been playing this game since day 1 and this is one of my first few turn based games that I ever played too. This game is so fun, farming is very easy since u don't need to do anything most of the time (autoplay exists), actually only time u need to manually play is when ur doing some mission which forces u to do so or in the endgame content. Very stress free game that u can just farm while ur class or while working too. Story is definitely top 10 for me (Luofu took it down a lot). It's very F2P.",5,2024-05-08 15:40:49

Doesn't tax my smartphone (Oppo 76A). Always note that smartphone can last 3 or 4 years of used if played games only. The game is turn base. Framing for material is slim less. Story line is well written also touch of comedy.,5,2024-05-08 15:28:31
"Can we Please have An Option to Increase or decrease Equilibrium Level Incase the Story Bosses are Element Specific and We are a new player? Cause Last Aventurine Boss was pretty Tough to Clear and I am stuck on 2.1 story ever since, because I lost on acheron's banner. Also what's worse is, Main event has limited rewards tied to completion of Story Quest, which Sucks. Imagine, you lose certain Time gated Rewards just because Dev's didn't account that not everyone is day one Player",1,2024-05-08 15:10:00

Star Rail is such an unserious game that pokes fun at itself. The jokes write themselves and uses the most famous memes. The music tracks used are (chef's kiss).

"The one to beat. Hoyoverse quality, a team that cares, generous rewards, excellent characters, a phenomenal story. This is the gold standard of gacha gaming, and good luck trying to dethrone it.",5,2024-05-08 10:58:52
"Previously 1-star because of error message. Has been played since last year and so far I have good experience. The plot and the character designs are interesting. Easy material farming because it has auto function. The developer is generous too always gives free 10-pull every patch. As F2P, it's enough. My problems are sometimes there is mistranslation for EN that's different from other language. Also please let us clear previous missions to reduce storage usage.",5,2024-05-08 10:58:13
This game is super generous i reccomend it,5,2024-05-08 10:55:47
"Please, make the game less storage heavy. I can't play or enjoy it when it takes up more space than I have on my phone! I want to play and purchase packages but I can't even fit the dang game!!",2,2024-05-08 10:49:36
I really like the gameplay it's not at all clunky and boring,5,2024-05-08 10:49:36
"Story is quite immersive, each character is special no matter the rarity. Graphics are stunning and clean, the game is overall quite generous to players and it's not required to spend money! Overall a very good game! Must try even if you aren't a space nerd.",5,2024-05-08 10:47:45

I really really really love this game. I would love it even more if Sunday is playable.,5,2024-05-08 10:40:10
"This is a good game besides genshin impact but the music in here is kinda lagging, it will be more good if the game file wasn't too large like 65 GB ??",4,2024-05-08 10:39:20
