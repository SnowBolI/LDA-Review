"it has fun combat, cool characters and music, and a decent story however recently it's been going downhill, whether it be the story with loads of dialogue and no skip button and half the characters not having voice actors, the fact it's nearly impossible to complete endgame content without getting the newest character or how the f2p experience is so much worse now, a year ago I would've given this game 5 stars and I really do love this game I just hope they fix all the issues",1,2025-06-18 11:16:27
no for me war freak üòÜ,1,2025-06-18 10:05:11
It's a really fun game though unfortunately it does suffer a fair bit from power creep. Older characters just don't do too great compared to the newer ones. Especially in any of the side content but also increasingly in the main story as well. Mostly due to artificially increased difficulty with bosses having increased hp or having to use a specific way or dealing damage that the newest characters are more optimized for.,4,2025-06-18 08:09:55
"This game has gone downhill. It's been so tiresome trying to beat any of the endgame stuff, due to power-creep and needing new characters that I have no interest in. Even the story is having issues. Penacony is where it started getting boring for me. It was nonsensical, obnoxious, and slow. This game had potential, but now, it's just a game to squeeze money out of people.",1,2025-06-18 06:41:37

"Gameplay used to be fun. Elemental weaknesses encouraged diverse teams. However, all of that has been scrapped in favor of newer, pay to win, all encompassing units that break the game. Now, the meta units just destroy everything on the field and ignore any mechanics implemented in the past. No strategy needed, no thinking. Dont even try to pull for any of the previous released dps units before 3.0. Story is now a drag. STILL No skip button yet. Cutscenes too short and few. Money Hungry HoYo.",1,2025-06-17 23:59:13
"Story is good but dialogue scenes are so static and boring, forcing players to look at unmoving character models with minimal gestures talking. It was better in v1.0 where dialogue scenes are more expressive. The devs can't give us properly animated dialogue scenes but can always make the powercreep higher, wow. And the characters designs are getting stale, you get a game involving different planets and almost none of that potential is being used, such boring clothing choices.",1,2025-06-17 23:10:20
"This was a great game. Now, at this point, I'm just disappointed by so many things. HP inflation is one of them. There is still no skip button, and the story just became very dull to me.

I used to enjoy this game and spend quite a lot just to catch up. But the game has been going downhill for a while. They keep introducing new overpowered characters as new meta. Older well build characters cannot even finish endgame content consistently. New story has been very weird and confusing. Cutscenes are terrible. Developer never listened to players.

I love Aventurine, I love gambling. He will come to life. He's forced to be fictional, he wants to be real and be with me. This is true. I am not delusional. I love Aven",5,2025-06-14 04:30:18
"I think this deserves a higher rating. the gameplay loop is solid. the only thing worth changing is the lack of auto pathing. so you kind of just walk to a random room (hallway simulator) -> intriguing fight with cool animations (üòÉüëç) -> multiple summary screens (ü§ì nerd behavior)-> hallway simulator. if they axed the hallway sim, I could grind with less stuff impacting me. this would make the game feel rewarding without excess waste (time).",4,2025-06-14 04:13:30

"ive been playing since 1.0. Everything about this game is great, except for the powercreep of new characters and hp inflation for endgame boss content that just gets worse by every update, forcing u to pull the newest over powered characters. yes giving buffs for some old characters in an upcoming patch is great, but why does it take that long to just buff certain characters? the story and everything else is perfect, just the problems above make this game more annoying to play in every patch",2,2025-06-14 02:17:32

Used to be fun but now it's sadly unbearable. It always has taken a long time to build up your characters which was always a drag but manageable. Unfortunately the storyline has been getting more and more dull with excessive Yap. The animations and characters were very great. The introduction of the global passive sadly is a very bad idea coupled with dreading a new lackluster story to drag through has me leaving. Had a lot of time invested into this game but that's how it goes I suppose. Adios.,3,2025-06-13 04:38:29

That is the reason. Even the YouTuber HomuLabs just plays the game because it's a Honkai game and he doesn't really like the turn based gameplay.

I would be more happy for story content.",3,2025-06-12 15:37:30
"Played since day 1, and to be fair, the game was never at the masterpiece it's hailed as. The story WAS good. Combat WAS okay if somewhat boring to me. Now, the story decided to derail into this random side plot that if you don't get hyped on the characters from the beginning, it's just boring and corny. The combat has been unbearable with the amount of catering it does to newer characters. I think I'll reserve the 20Gb on my phone for better games.",1,2025-06-12 14:14:15
"I really enjoyed this one for the first year after launch and a little after; but we've reached a point where HP inflation and character powercreep has become abhorrent.

"It had a nice story and art style, but gameplay is a boring turn based system. As expected the enemies are getting power crept in every patch including characters.

Dialogue has gotten even longer in stories, character stories are now just forced into the main ones instead of being a side mission. Not recommended.",1,2025-06-12 08:47:23
Star rail is my favorite game but it takes an unnecessary amount of storage. It was taking 35GB on my phone. I'm sure the devs can think of a better solution for this but so far all our complaints have fallen on deaf ears. 2025 update: the lack of engaging events has made me not want to play as much. it's no longer my fave game. i miss when it was actually good,2,2025-06-12 07:20:03

I don't understand how this is a million dollar company but you guys put such little effort in the story it's basically just reading a constant wall of dialogue or words on a white/black screen.

"I have to say it, the game's gotten boring. The constant gigabyte updates, slowness, very low frame rates, and things barely give anything. I used to be able to get a new character, slap a few things on it and just go with the storyline. Now it feels like I HAVE to perfectly build my characters in order to get past an enemy. Not only that building characters takes a long time and gets really boring really fast. I hope hsr does something to change the game drastically and make it a lot more fun.",2,2025-06-02 06:51:50

"I like the designs of the characters, even if they make flour look like the color black in comparison to their skintones. Stories are honestly great, and they're working to finally fix the powercreep issue. Screw the meta, people care too much about the damage outcome that they forget to just have fun.

You'd think that would stop powercreep but its actually the opposite. Your $2000 character is trash in comparison to the $2000 character released 2 months later.",2,2025-05-26 01:36:31
Power creep power creep and more power creep. Your character want stay relevant more than 6 months,1,2025-05-26 00:31:01
"Played for 2 years. Quit the game with no intention of returning. Combat is stale, lacks depth and consists of auto-battling that will run you 10 minutes of ult-animations most days. Do not expect to get most characters through the gacha without spending. New events feel stiff, soulless and lack the charm of older ones. Obtaining upgrade mats and equipment will be your life. Genuinely, I would not recommend this game unless you want to be disappointed after catching up with the main story.",1,2025-05-25 23:47:03
Greatest gacha of all time. Free to play friendly and lots of quality of life compared to other gachas.,5,2025-05-25 23:22:21

"It was my favorite game. I loved every part of it but the predatory tactics they apply with the current hyper aggressive team obsolescence is unbearable. The writing quality from the history missions has tanked. And the worse, Hoyo is supporting the abuse of worker rights to voice actors, hiring replacements to violate the right to protest and strike from them.

I didn't mind waiting until they were able to record their lines for the game and now I have no desire to actually play it anymore, which hurts so much more because of how much I loved the game. The story, music, characters were amazing, their voice actors gave them something even more unique for them and now I feel like that's all gone.

But it feels a little... lax nowadays as compared to before. but still a good casual game to play. ‚ù§Ô∏è",4,2025-05-23 22:00:51

I was only playing for a chance at a free boothill pull and I have been physically unable to make enough room on my phone to download this game since the 2nd anniversary. I don't know what changed?

"This game is fantastic. It's the nature of a gacha game that you'll get frustrated with your pulls at times. But all this ""yapping"" the other reviews refer to is a fantastic story.

"Getting into this game is like falling through a building of glass and nails. Each patch makes it progressively worse, between poorly written bland waifu bait for the tasteless and absurd powercreep.

"The Amphoreus story has great potential but the developers really did a great job making it so boring and cheap.

"Day 1 player here. I absolutely loved this game when it came out, and from 1.0 to 2.0, this game was magical, even with it's bumps here and there. It was honestly a 5* game. Ever since 2.1 this game has slowly become a big slog to me, both gameplay wise and story/character wise. Stopped playing with 3.0 when I tried to weather the storm thinking Amphoreus would be a change of scenery and pace. But with so much recasting and needing new characters, it is just unfun.",1,2025-05-21 11:18:59
"Fun gameplay, great character design. But the story feels very slow because of the continous yapping that sometimes makes it feel like it is being extended only to retain players longer. There is also a serious problem of powercreep with old characters like Seele. Which needs an extreme environment and stats to work.",2,2025-05-21 11:17:53
"it was peak at some points of the main story, though for Amphoreus, as much as I love the quests tailored on specific characters, it does seem unnecessary since that Tribbie's past was revealed only to make krateros to understand the history and it can be overwhelming to complete the quests, there's also immense powercreep, I am an invested player and it took me so many tries to complete the MOC 3.1 and I was never able to defeat it within 10 cycles after that attempt, tho their designs rock",3,2025-05-21 11:08:27

"My favorite aspect of this game is the combat system. It touches all my favorite preferences for turn-based combat with a unique system scarcely seen elsewhere. The story is great as well if you can get past the first section of the Loufu (bit of a drag). Story used to peek in Belabog, but the peek is Penacony now imo. Highly recommend! As far as P2W vs F2P goes, getting characters obviously makes the late game content vastly easier, but is not necessary for normal gameplay at all. F2P friendly!",5,2025-05-21 10:59:45
"I really really love this game, I've always had my eye on it ever since pre-registration, the story is good, the characters are awesome and well written. The problem is that there's little to no 4 stars and most of them are trash. The powercreep is INSANE. New 5 stars just fall off after about 4 patches or so + sometimes you need to get their signature lightcone in order for them to actually work. It feels like a pay to win game atp. Maybe fix the powercreep issue and add more USEFUL 4 stars.",2,2025-05-21 10:57:35

"The power creep is insane. They lost their way. Used to be fun, but honestly not worth time investment. Game is predatory with endgame content geared only towards newer units, you used to be able to use diverse teams and build for fun to clear but now it requires you to always pull for the latest banner and risk losing a 50/50 and just having to skip banners.

from my personal experince this is one of the better gacha games that care more about the game then the money(only rivaled by wuwa) you can essentially get more than 1 five star every patch if you put effort into the game. the most recent patch amphoreus is definitely worth playing and the characters are very well written,5,2025-05-21 09:26:43

Better than genshin impact and and a much better fanbase too (thank God)! It's clear that the devs care about the game and listen to player feedback! Very fun and runs well on most devices! It deserved the game of the year title that it got! **Update** it's been a few years and the game has fallen off hard. It's not terrible but it's nowhere near as peak as it once was,3,2025-05-21 08:53:58
"despite what others say and the inclusion of Castorice global passive. It's still a fun game and the powercreep isn't as bad as they make it out to be, the main story you can goof around In and even an idiot like me can make half decent teams, the story fun aswell, it's got decent jokes, community memes, callbacks to past events and it's interesting. Much better than other free Gacha games on the app store.",5,2025-05-21 08:53:37
"Add a skip button. The story and dialogue has way too many yapping moments that sometimes isn't even relevant to what's happening. It won't take away from anything, it's just a QoL for people who wanna complete the main quest but doesn't wanna spend hours just sifting through pointless dialogue, especially for new or returning players who wanna try out the new events or other events that are locked behind completing the new quest.",3,2025-05-21 08:44:39

I love this game and been playing sense release. wish I could give it 5 stars but some of the complaints from the lower ratings are pretty valid. power creep is pretty harsh and this is coming from a spender who likes to collect characters but not spend so much to max eidolons. the global passive is a op mechanic and I personally hope they aren't going to make that a common thing. story is definitely meh. more time locked in conversations and idle chatter then actual trailblazing,4,2025-05-21 08:22:57

"1.0 player here. I'm changing my review of this game since many of the aspects I loved about this game is being abandoned. - The storytelling is becoming convoluted with much of the elements feeling dragged on with little payoff. - The relevency of older characters are diminished, meaning that making long-term investments on characters feel wasted. - The lack of new combat events and modes means that the only end-game combat is limited to a mode that refreshes every 2 weeks.

In all my hours and hours of playing since her release, I have NEVER had to use the passive on a BUILT team. Castorice's Passive isn't the problem. People's teams are. Know HOW to play the game, and you'll clear the content. There are PLENTY of standards only and 4* only character clears, and all these 1* reviews ignore.

It is a gacha, and the character strengths are bound to always change and evolve into stronger and better capabilities as the game gets older. The company wants to make money, but they've made a game that can be free to play if you're not character hungry. It just takes time and effort. WORTH IT!!!!

"I absolutely love this game. I used to play Genshin, but quit because it felt endless for farming for one character. Instead, Star Rail is very free-to-play friendly.

Has a well thought out and engaging story with pretty decent twists and great lore imo. 10/10, also F2P friendly.",5,2025-05-21 05:31:40

This game used to have so many events but now its just bad. For a turn based rpg this game has so much potential but the powercreep in MoC is too bad.

I will start by saying that I actually really love 3.0 and its patches-- it's nice for the story to finally have stakes and consequences. However, there NEEDS to be a skip button. The global passive makes people who got lucky at getting the character have an advantage, and new players who start after said character releases are immediately disadvantaged.

I absolutely enjoy playing Honkai star rail ever since I had downloaded the game yet the problem now is the constant crash out of the game. I've been annoyed to the point I wouldn't want to play the game anymore due to this problem everyday if I attempt to play or battle for at least 30 minutes. I want this to be fixed for me to enjoy the game as if not then I will unfortunately delete the game due to the often times the game crashes even despite my phone being a gaming one.,3,2025-05-16 14:43:01
"I've been playing since 2.0, and the game for me in general has fallen off pretty badly.

So far I could say that I still love the game. there is now a global passive that definitely cause major issue in the game mechanics that'll surely gonna make that certain character pretty unbalanced.

I understand releasing stronger characters to sell more characters but do the old characters have to become useless? I've been playing since 1.0 and adore this game, but it's become way too stressful to handle nowadays.",1,2025-05-14 12:18:49

It takes forever to build 1 character. The artifacts (which is used to make your characters do more damage) is so RNG based that it's literally impossible to build them unless you plan on spending thousands of dollars on this game. Then the next update the character will be useless because they buff enemies or release a better version of the character to force you to spend more money.,1,2025-05-14 03:03:58

Amphoreus is a massive downgrade. The power creep, hp inflation and needing the newest characters to complete game modes such as moc is tiring; older characters are useless now.

It's embarrassing to even call HSR a turn-based game because that's evidently the least of their focus. There's no depth, just the bare minimum.

Powercreep and HP inflation is essentially out of control and future units have QoL features locked behind Eidolons, a literal paywall.",1,2025-05-10 05:15:27

"FIRST REVIEW?? Actual review: very good. As someone who's played genshit for 2 years it's better tbh. Turn based combat is just more fun and the characters are better. Download it, trust Update: still good, just sucks everyone got bored of it, I take long breaks, but I always come back. It's good, just doesn't have much content after you explore everything. Just like genshin. But there's a tonnn on content on genshin, and honkai has less, obviously. UPDATE: temp 1 star cus not f2p friendly",1,2025-05-10 03:31:29

"Investing in your favorite characters is useless because they get powercrept with the next new character released. They just want you to keep spending money and pull new characters that you don't even like. They go out of their way to make sure you can't use your old teams that you invested a lot of time and money to build. And because that's not enough, if you want to play just for the story, don't bother. Nothing in the story makes sense and is boring.",5,2025-05-09 18:29:37

At least Genshin has harder worldbuilding and an end goal to look forward to, which is to unearth Teyvat's secrets and what made the Abyss twin switch up.

It's power creep central in Star Rail. as long as you're cool with pulling every character the game still feels fun for the most part, but these devs are the worst at balancing their game. I've never seen such a shameless power creep, it's non-stop and too hard to keep up with every month.

I was a supporter of Mihoyo in the past but got fed up with it (played the Honkai Impact 3 even b4 the first edition swimsuit skin for 3 B rank character so u can imagine). The power crept existed long before HSR even existed dating way back HI3. They address the power crept by making new gacha weapons for the character instead of changing the mechanic or introducing buff that is locked behind story. This game is good and will last but if like an abusive relationship be my guest.,1,2025-05-08 00:13:52
the start of the gameplay was excellent but as you progress more into the endgame contents you'll find it extremely hard to fit into the current meta as its always changing. With this absurd power creeps the game is becoming more difficult and difficult to the point it's near impossible to beat the end game contents without paying anything. Another thing is how its becoming unbearable for some devices especially low end cellphone's to keep up with the cut scenes due to how high the graphics are,1,2025-05-07 23:54:23

For a game that's turn based and barely open world I would expect more from it. I think your quests also focus too much on the character you're trying to promote each patch.,1,2025-05-07 05:41:07

"It's a good game. It is also somewhat f2p friendly. However, if you want to clear most of the end game content, you need to play the game a lot and grind a lot. So I wouldn't necessarily say it's good if you want a game that you can just play casually. The character designs are amazing, and so is the story. The lore is also very interesting. Also, the power creep is VERY noticeable, especially after the release of Castorice.",5,2025-05-07 00:42:35

Bland, lack of thoughts, lack of passion, waste of time, and an overhyped colossal mess of nothing are what I would describe the ""game"".

always played this game everyday and got very addicted to it.This was my favourite since it didn't need that much exploration. however i have failed to catch up because of the release of many 5 star characters and the pressure to keep pulling chracters.It takes so much time to build characters and the powercreep is just insane.It's like everytime a 5 star character is released the other old 5 star chacters are not relevant anymore.,1,2025-05-03 23:23:15

While it has been on a bit of a downward spiral, I am holding out hope that it learns from the player feedback and puts more effort into the story and gameplay instead of dialogue.

Edited review : This game is going in such a horrible direction with powercreep. New events are so uninspired. The characters now have a forced auto-battle inserted into their kits that you can't even control them and who knows what they might implement next. They treat male characters as beta for female characters. Males are harder to play and with issues while female characters are sm easier to play (maybe coz they think goon audience isn't smart enough to play them lol),3,2025-05-01 21:28:06

"Used to like the game despite how easy it is. But the way they keep releasing less and less content, going against what the playerbase wants (shown with the poor rating of 2.6 currently). Plus this patch doesn't like an aniversary (3.2). An aniversary should be the time to have more different gameplay, to be able to play the game more. Instead they give more stuff but no gamemode to use it on. It's a free game, sure, but I base that on what the game used to provide VS what it provides now.",1,2025-05-01 13:32:20

The game is constantly putting out stronger characters and stronger mechanics that players can't really catch up without spending money or spending a lot of time on the game. The fun gameplay is ruined by the constantly changing meta and favorite characters and severely underpowered against the current challenges.

It started out as a fun and awesome game but now ever since Amphoreus released it went downhill fast with character kit choices and the fact that their have only been 5 stars released since release that are too OP to the point where they are needed for an account which isn't f2p friendly and I literally couldn't beat a boss in amphoreus with my own characters that I had where I needed to get The Herta to actually beat it on the regular mode in the story not the casual mode. I hope it gets better,1,2025-05-01 10:42:12
"as someone who's been playing since release, I'm surprised I'm not burned out yet unlike genshin who I quit after 3.4 update. people have been complaining about powercrept, and the hp inflation as well but all in all I don't care, im fine with not full clearing each endgame mode (though I cleared the recents ones due to having castorice and fugue now, I don't mind that there's not much to do either as I'm busy.

"Don't listen to the losers and complainers who are pressed about a little global passive and powercreeping. You can still play the game perfectly fine. Those people NEED to complain about something constantly. It's dopamine for them. This is a free game, they don't owe you anything. Also, this is a TURN BASED RPG. The game IS the story. If you can't handle it, this game isn't for you, and don't play. Sick of people complaining about that too.",5,2025-04-29 16:17:50

You reroll the stats, and somehow, they are still just as bad.

When I first joined in 2.3 this game was genuinely fun. until I reached endgame content where all u do is do dailies after u finish the main story. Powercreep has gotten insanely terrible where my FART team (All S1 with Aventurine and Robin E1) where I spent so much time and dedication investing for this team is struggling in the amphoreus content. Story is getting more and more yapping without a skip button is awful. Will change rating and rewrite the review once the game improves,1,2025-04-27 08:32:45
"This game could have been so great, but the developers (or board of directors, most likely) have decided they would rather innovate to new levels of greed, rather than f2p friendly gameplay. Also, the writer they tout as ""so good"" actually puts out C tier yap fests they call a 'story'.",1,2025-04-27 08:23:57
"used to spend hundreds of hours on this game and even do my dailies and weeklies like clockwork. latest world feels way too padded with minigames, puzzles and lots of unskippable dialogue. this was my breaking point sadly. if only there was a skip button for all the dialogue (especially the lengthy convos). gameplay no longer is fighting monsters to progress, you now do tedious puzzles and run a marathon just to get to the next part of the plot. i lost all interest to save jades for fate collab",2,2025-04-27 07:50:17
"the reason I'm giving it 1 is Because when I was on the core flame submitting thing where you have to tap and hold I probably held the button for 5 straight minutes and was stuck on that part and couldn't get out of it , maybe if you fix it I'll raise the rating",1,2025-04-27 06:49:37

I can sit through years worth of cutscenes that I've missed that aren't skip able and my team is super outdated with a long grind to get any new characters.

"I used to consider this a 5/5 for the fun story despite the gacha. However the powercreep of the gacha is so extreme now that characters can fall off a cliff in power, with even the main story has insane jumps in difficulty, and they've added a global passive to a character meaning no matter your team, its optimal to own them. save your time, and especially your money, and play something else.",2,2025-04-24 09:06:10

"This used to be an amazing game but... The introduction of global passives power creeps every character, and now if you want to reach endgame and complete it, you basically NEED to warp/pull for a character. Which is pretty bad, and theres not many updates any more, in my opinion. Which makes the game a lot more boring. I love Castorice, the new character who has global passive. But, she powercreeps my heavily invested into Acheron. Which is very bad. Overall, this game is.. Not the best.",2,2025-04-24 07:00:37
"End game content is difficult without the meta characters and the best teams but if you really like certain characters, you can spend 4 months farming for the best relics for them and pray you clear it.

"I've been playing since release. It was good at first, but the downfall is really saddening. The story peaked at Belobog, and Penacony was somewhat tolerable, but that's it. Not to mention the terrible balancing system this game has, keep pulling meta characters, or you won't be able to full star moc, pure fiction, and apocalyptic shadows. Unlike other games by hoyoverse (genshin and zzz) where you can still clear endgame with 4 stars and A ranks. I'd give 0 stars if the system allowed me to.",1,2025-04-24 04:14:44

With the recent news about how much each pull costs, over $21 for a single 10 pull is a bit too much when you take into account that the pitty for actually pulling a 5 star is 90 pulls, and the guarantee for getting the banner character is 180 pulls. While the events are fairly generous, they still leave much to be desired especially if you are unable to play every day. Visuals are stunning and gameplay is rewarding, honestly a shame.",2,2025-04-24 00:38:45

"HP Inflation and Powercreeping are just getting ridiculous by the day. Old characters buff is just way too late and its only some characters who got buffed in 3.4 (characters like DHIL & Topaz are litterally as good as garbage right now), nobody is using them anymore and the devs just act like hero when buffing them. Not much animations in the story and just slapping everything with texts & Images. Used to like this game a lot, but this game are getting worse every patch.

"i love the gameplay but quit for a while because it became so tedious. the story no longer interests me and takes way too long, way too much dialogue. there should at least be a skip button for it. i understand needing to engage players and fund your games and etc by releasing new characters but the power creeping is insane. the new char literally is so blantant with it, having crit and crit dmg built into their traces and passives. the chars are still pretty and top notch battle animations tho",3,2025-04-22 10:27:50

"Still a five star for me even though there is power creep.

Incredible battles and animations, but number tuning and power creep so intense characters you built in 1.0 are almost all totally useless. Wildly interesting storylines told with the grace of Michael Bay whose budget was 2 barbie dollhouses and his inhouse animation studio for wildly lavish cutscenes that can be no more than 20 seconds long. Incredible character kits whose power is typically neutered without other limited ssrs. Why.",2,2025-04-20 04:27:55

The game is amazing and the combat is really fast paced and action packed for a turn based game. my complaints are that once you get up to level 80 it takes a long time to get the necessary materials to upgrade your character to make them powerful enough for basic combat and the main quests can be tedious because of how long the dialogue and cutscenes can get without a break. I wish they would balance combat and story better. nevertheless the story and characters are engaging and interesting.,4,2025-04-17 03:55:48
Decently fun game but don't bother they're adding global passives. If you don't know all you have to do is pull a character and your account gets a permanent buff so you either have to save every free gem they give or spend that nice big 300. I've played a lot of these games and this is by far the worst mechanic I've ever seen. Other games have had this mechanic and I'm telling you the endgame for them was impossible because the devs have to assume you have all the buffs. TLDR;Don't bother,1,2025-04-17 03:52:03

Great game at first but now it's beyond greedy and stupid. The powercreep is real,1,2025-04-16 14:40:12
The devs powercreep characters even mere patches after they are out. The worst part is that there are literal 1-to-1 powercreeps. Building characters is slow and super RNG heavy. Then they release global passives that are active if you have the character without them even being in the party. The only way to keep up with the rapid stream of new characters is with micro transactions which the devs constantly add new ones of.,1,2025-04-16 14:38:55

Idk why people are just review bombing this game just because castorice is out like so what global passive this global passive that it's just a game lmao don't play it anymore if you are so upset. don't get me wrong I couldn't care less where this game is going I just pull who I want and enjoy the game however it is. still great to enjoy I love Castorice I have her E2 and I can still use my other teams for the entire game without needing her.,5,2025-04-15 18:18:02
"It's very hard to enjoy the game when your fav characters got constantly powercrept. You won't be able to clear the endgames unless you have the shiniest new character, yet they, too, would be irrelevant after their banners ended. You also need their copies and their lightcones for them to work properly. They haven't given f2p options as well bc theres just no new four star characters. There's about 40 five stars and only 23 four stars. HOW IS THE 4* MORE RARE THAN 5*s???",1,2025-04-15 18:15:08
I love the graphics and the music and characters are amazing,5,2025-04-15 17:26:00

"5star characters are very prone to powercreep even within 2 - 3 updates. 90% of the 4 star are useless on the current meta. worse of all, they increase the power level of the current story content enemy and end game mode battles requiring new 5 star character as well as other 5 stars team mate( most likely the newer character) in order to clear the content at reasonable difficulties otherwise you played in hardcore difficulty. hope the dev change their ways but doubtful",1,2025-04-15 16:57:06

"I went into this game with no intention to spend money knowing it was a gacha. I lost interest in the story during the penacony region. One of the literal main quests is to gather ingredients for a drink. The gameplay is good, but so many elements of the game are truly a time waster. The 2nd anniversary was the last straw.",2,2025-04-15 16:04:53
"The game was great, with great emphasis on ""was"", the rampant powercreep is too much, powercreep in turn-based gacha games is to be expected, however, the developers fail to take action to remedy this issue. As for the story, a single word can explain its entirety, ""yapfest"". In all honesty, Belobog was this game's peak in terms of story, and everything else cannot compare.",1,2025-04-15 15:56:19
too much QOL update but cant even add skip button for too much yapping.. not everyone has enough time to spam the mouse or keyboard to skip lines especially non related to the main story. Let people decide if they're into the yapping or not 2 yrs anniversary but a simple skip button cant be added to the game.. ohh btw you force players to spend hours for a Story with a bland face with no voice actors/ voices,1,2025-04-15 15:32:00

"I used to love Honkai: Star Rail and rated it 5 stars. But now, it feels disappointing. Power creep makes older characters useless, and new ones are almost mandatory for harder content. The gacha rates are low, making it frustrating to pull what you want. Even the story feels less engaging over time. It‚Äôs still a good-looking game, but the fun and fairness are fading. Changing my rating to 2 stars. üò°ü•∫",2,2025-04-15 14:01:02

"Day 1 player, but I dropped out after the Xianzhou disaster. Belobog was a great start, but I never understood why this game is about exploring entire planets, and yet everyone is always human-like. Why tf NPCs look better than playables?? I'm not saying Star Rail needs to be donghua Star Wars, but the diversity is lacking. There's just so many underlying & BLATANT problems with the whole game that I'm glad I'm missing out. Anyone who falls for the fanservice deserves to have their money taken.",1,2025-04-15 13:11:16

For the game it is that it has very good gameplay and lore when it first release but the main issue that I've com across is that lack of 4 stars in the game and when the new map was released (Amphorea) they didn't release a new 4 star ever since and because if that it makes the game even harder. As for the 5 stars they have a massive issue of powercreep which makes it says unenjoyable when you get a 5 star and you realize it will get powercreep in the next three months or so.,1,2025-04-15 09:30:29
"The game was good and fun. The devs seemed to care about the community. Now, they seem to care about money. Power creep is ridiculous. I'm not a whale or a F2P, and I will say...I'm about done with this game. I don't know how F2P players will keep up with this powercreep. Go back to producing something that we can enjoy... you have enough money already!",1,2025-04-15 08:49:58

"Although I understand everyone's issues with stuff mainly concerning the power creep, hp inflation, etc. However, I rate it a 5 star because I enjoy every other part of the game, from its story to the characters. Moreover, some people think that the game isn't f2p friendly but I really think that's just hot air as I'm also a f2p player but stellar jades are easy to earn with the game content and big rewards that continue to be added. This is especially obvious when you compare it to Genshinüòë.",5,2025-04-15 06:33:29

"Great gaming experience overall, but it has way too little of ""show, don't tell"". A lot of the story could've been told in a way more interesting and concise way as the story of the game is very good. The way they tell the story sometimes can really do a disservice to what they may have wanted to tell. Even as a casual player, I do believe character power creep can be overwhelming. It would be different if you could clear content with older characters, but unfortunately it is near impossible.",3,2025-04-15 05:59:39

I used to love everything about this game. The only reason I still play it is because of the story and that's it. I have up on the end game content since version 2.3 and I'm not even bothered to get characters anymore because they will be useless in a few months.

they changed up the MO of one of the bosses to force the need for Castorice's revive mechanic. Hoolay doesn't normally take one member of your team and force them into a one on one standoff. in that stance they can't be healed or take shields with them even if gepard fires his ult and gives your team members full shields just before hoolay takes them. your unit has to survive the onslaught literally alone and hope they survive. this feels like coercion to pull for a character you don't even want,1,2025-04-14 11:23:43

Used to be fun but consistant predatory game design has reached new levels. I have played this everyday since a few weeks after launch. It had good character designs and the early story quests were very interesting. Since then quality has taken a notable decline culminating in the devs crossing the line with predatory game design with the release of Castorice.

What used to be top tier units now have difficulties clearing anything new and the new enemies are tailor made to be fought with these new limited units.

MOC is impossible to clear unless you pull the new unit, and it will only hold until 3-4 patch, after that that unit will be trash ,unusable. and then now with global passive they push you to pull the new unit. just greedy developer, will never touch any game from this dev anymore",1,2025-04-12 20:17:17

"Compare this to other HV games, this game is surprisingly very barebone. It doesn't even have any skins. Pretty much the only thing to do is story, endgame and events, but there are so few events in each patch that you might as well not count it. The story is good... for only the first 7 hrs. The combat is so shallow, and the powercreep is so aggressive. Probably the first turn-based I've played that you can't even use any item during combat.",1,2025-04-12 18:49:35

no new decent 4star characters and f2p five stars are not well enough to clear all contents in game and all old characters are useless in game. At this point I can't even enjoy this game.

"The visual, story are so goood 100% , but this game is reviving my truama in genshin, it's getting toxic, always losing both lightcones and characters is tiring, but yes they are generous- that generosity is not enough, i just want pull for the characters i want but they are powercreeped like crazy-so needpull meta chars to keep up but if im kept on losing like this yeaa no. i miss the old hsr where all the chars and npc have voices. this is so tiring",4,2025-04-12 01:17:01
"I have played since release, and the start of this game was an easy 5 stars up until maybe halfway through penacony. Don't know where all the money is going, but it sure isn't being used to improve the game. Quality has gone down and powerceep is absurd. Barely any quality cutscenes in hours upon hours of bland story. New characters go straight through elements, defeating the rpg mechanic in the first place. Global passives set very bad precedent. Events are just lazy mini games. Very sad.",2,2025-04-12 01:16:46
"If you want to try this game out then ignore the negative reviews because those people do not play the game, they log in once a week or month and expect to have every or almost every character for free. If you play the game then you get enough currency to get one new character every patch or more. Plus, they are giving away Limited characters for free as they get older. Don't take advice from people who have ulterior motives and try the game for yourselves.",5,2025-04-12 01:14:56
The game is neat at first but the characters NEVER stop talking. is this even a game? I hardly get to play. I want to enjoy the gameplay loop but so much time is locked up in unskippable dialogue. Until we can skip the dialogue bloat this will not move from 1 star.,1,2025-04-12 01:12:04

The 'celebrations' are paid, the character gives an ability that breaks the balance by simply existing on your account and the devs shamelessly release characters that powercreep previous ones despite it being an ongoing problem for a long time.

"honestly, the game is beautiful and so are the stories. There will be many opinions but let's be honest, hsr is a really beautiful game. although the reason why I give it 4 stars and not 5 star it's because old 5 star limited characters are no use anymore for end games. they keep getting power crep by new 5 star limited characters. which is in my opinion, kinda unfair. Besides that, thank you for the free Runa mei~!",4,2025-04-11 23:58:55

"The devs is a genius. Instead of focusing the core problem of powercreep, HP inflation, etc. to fix or at least slowing them down, they're making Global Passive that's only making it worse. Let's not mention how they're blatantly using endgame content to fully favor new units. If you new players interested in this game, don't. The Path system? They're useless lol.

I remember when I first pulled for Acheron and how I could zero cycle the endgame, now I cant even finish the MoC(easiest one) in 5 cycles, im not even at MoC 12 btw.

"Riddled with powercreep, favoritism, greed and now feels like a cheap money grab. Male characters get no love. Take the most recent male character released, they made the dumb decision to make his entire gameplay just auto-attacks. On top of having a clear lack of effort put into his animations compared to the next character released it shows sad favoritism. Also unless you're using the current waifu shill, expect your character to end up struggling with any new content with the powercreep",1,2025-04-11 20:19:33

"played at day 1 and took pauses to play and this is my pure honest review. addressing power creep : due to my low activity I've never worried about meta but recently since 3.1 the MOC 11 and 12 have been way harder to make it short you lose out on about 2-3 pull every 45 days with all endgame modes combined if you don't have the best characters but good ones if you have the ""bad"" ones you'll lose out on 5-6 pull every 45 days maybe brainrot has gotten to me but story feels worse than before.",3,2025-04-11 17:37:36
"Enjoy the game yourself, do not listen those ""competitive"" players. If you are a casual player you would still enjoy the game even if you are F2P It's a bit challenging but it is not impossible. I mean, why would you want to play this game without challenges in the first place? It's a single player game, just enjoy the story and go with the flow. If you can manage the currency well from rewards, you can pull good characters for free though.",5,2025-04-11 17:37:24

MONEY SUCKING BANNERS!!! edited: I forgot to mention that this game forced me to quit for giving me 86pity gepard in Sunday's release. Genshin, ZZZ and Wuwa never did this to me.

People are getting fearmongered by their favourite content creators into quitting and that is absolutely crazy lmao I just think you should stop complaining about the endgame if you're not willing to put time into it.

"The story used to be okay when it felt fresh and new, but from the start, it was yap-central. Some patches are several hours of lazily-presented, uninspired, badly-written story you cannot skip for every 2 minutes of gameplay, half of which are loading screens. the rest is walking about in 2 dimensions in enclosed maps. Every new character is an excuse to powercreep all others by bloating endamge boss stats so you buy the new characters.

power creep is getting out of hand. i know there will always be power creep for these games as its f2p. but i think after this update they cross that line towards p2w for end game. gave it a 2 star if you only want to play for the story.,2,2025-04-11 09:09:58
"Every 5 stars characters eventually turn into 4 stars whenever new one coming out. Jingliu, seele, silver wolf etc. They keep increasing the difficulties to sell new character banners.",1,2025-04-11 08:58:38
Started as a good game. The current state is an utter unplayable garbage.,1,2025-04-11 08:51:00
"personally, a 3 star is fair imo because the blatant powercreep is getting wild, and yes, they said old character will be getting a face-lift, but their basicly adding more monetisation becuase now u have questionable global passives wich we can't really judge for now becuase its way 2 early.And personally myself if these global passives get really out of hand then I will stop playing and not to mention the constant HP to enemies suck but people need to chill with the review bombing",3,2025-04-11 08:29:49
"I play casual, so I still enjoy the game mainly due to me winning a lot of 50/50 pulls, and the game just looking really cool in general, but the direction hoyo took with the introduction of castorice revival ability and the hp increase on enemies makes it a little less enjoyable at times and i feel for those players with new accounts. Castorice revival ability is only just the beginning. Who knows how much longer I'll keep playing.",1,2025-04-11 08:23:36

"The anniversary is just straight uo scummy with a bunch of things pay walled or time locked so that whales will spend and people will log in. Why in the world is one of the events just a 'spend money' event? aren't you supposed to be celebrating the players, not the devs?",1,2025-04-11 08:11:16
"1 star is too much in this case. Old characters are completely and fully irrelevant in the end game modes and also in some regular quest battles. New characters are way stronger than old ones and new enemies have way more HP. New basic mobs have higher HP than bosses in the beginnings of the game. Buffing old units wont fix it, I very doubt so. We get also only few free rewards while developers pretend like 30 wishes for anniversary are a lot. There is hardly anything positive about this game.",1,2025-04-11 07:38:17

"The story in this game is very amazing but the issue with its HP inflation and meta always falling off every 2 patches just gets so overwhelming to the point that you have to pull for actual uninteresting meta characters that you dont want. AND if you do want, they're always nerfed at the end (I was very hyped about Anaxa until now). Im still very upset about Castorice's global passive that shouldn't even exist on a gacha game. Im so scared for future updates just on how the meta keeps updating",2,2025-04-11 06:43:14
"Global passive is big NO NO üôÖ and barely any events to do, starting to get boring. NO SKIP button for the main stories, NO new 4 stars, low on rewards, We don't want the white screen with black writing in it, we just need more cutscenes and dev don't listen to players opinion. Developer are greedy, it's time to move on to other game that have more generous rewards. For new player, this game not good for you.",1,2025-04-11 06:41:07

the games decent you can get the currency to get gacha tickets very easily which that i like and it does have a turn based rpg element. still havent got far into the story but adventure ranks are a pain to deal with along with leveling a character after a battle since it doesnt give out decent xp at all. but 4/5 stars i guess.,4,2025-04-11 06:06:10

However after I downloaded the game and attempted to start it up I was met with dissapointment. This game is not playable on laptop, it opens to a very small chunk of the usual loading screen showing only a bright shade of pink. The game will only crash after attempting to load in.

It always disconnects from time to time sometimes forcing me to replay cutscenes with no skip available.

This game was so good back then but as months passed by the game's power creep kept getting insane. The new Castorice globally passive is crazy too They will keep releasing more characters with global passive in the future which will ruin the entire game even more. I mean in the end it's another Gacha game so I am not surprised at all. HoYoverse just can't get enough money.,1,2025-04-11 02:01:22

"I don't even remember when I quit TS, but I'mma participate on the review bombing lol",1,2025-04-11 01:15:20
This game desperately needs a dialogue skip option. 3.2 story is ~8 hour long with like 10 min cutscene (gameplay included). Story might be good but the presentation is the worst i've ever seen. The dev team assured us they will improve it in 3.2 but its the same slop (or even worse) than before. The only new thing is the white screen with black texts and black screens with RED texts. Nice. The devs or directors definitely deserves an applause for this. They've outdone themselves.,1,2025-04-11 01:01:35
"I think these new story lines, also a few patches before, they liked to kill the characters, I mean really frequently right now, it makes me lose interest to play because for them it's making the story better, but they don't even know how to do it and act all smart thinking everyone will love it, I don't care about any of the characters global passive or anything, just bad writing making me want to skip the story and just receive the rewards.",1,2025-04-11 00:54:53

"Updated review: I still like the story and the characters are still pretty good, but there's definitely a fundamental difference between 1.0 and 3.2 Gacha feels like a necessity, the last events were bland and boring, the HP inflation and no 4* characters being released since almost more than 9 months just shows how the game has come off their course to be F2P friendly. So to any who do like to experience the story, it pays off, but it definitely has fallen, devs don't listen to players anymore.",3,2025-04-11 00:04:28
so much power creep. it's not worth trying anymore when it only depends on what characters you have. no skill needed just a character check. even the story isn't worth it anymore. it's just characters talking for several hours with nothing interesting. just endless boring dialogue with just a little bit of story at the end.,1,2025-04-11 00:00:55
"this game was my beloved too, i was engaging in it since its first launch. and i was quitting too, hoyo are always gross like that: an absolute neglect to their own players, racism, disengaging storytelling and POWERCREEP. a recipe for a disaster. it's so easy to turn your comfort game into some shapeless meaningless mess for them. i really don't understand how one could build an entire empire, predatory company and just get away with it every single day. please, consider using your money wisely",1,2025-04-11 00:00:42

Lack of events, no three team content like zzz, no endless tower mode like zzz, lack of qol updates, no new 4 star since moze, way too many 5 stars.

"So far so good. The game is generous enough to give you enough characters to build 2 decent teams even as f2p. Though some end-game contents like MOC are hard to clear using f2p team. My biggest concern right now is the lack of resources. Maxing chars need a ton of resources. Hope they provide more energy in the future or make the resources easier to get. All in all, it is f2p friendly but it will take a lot longer to build your chars and teams compared to spenders who can refresh energy.",1,2025-04-10 17:54:54

They do not listen to feedback, and when they do, they implement it in a way that is borderline condescending to the player.

As a longtime player I no longer enjoy the game anymore. The lack of team diversity for endgame content is a big issue. This combined with a very tedious grind for the right substats in equipment make it tough to rec. As a story based game its passable though quality has declined significantly since Belobog (1st world),2,2025-04-10 09:34:23
"Stop trying to make me pull Castorice. I'm never going to do that no matter how many promotions you jam down my throat. Reason #1: her design is bland as hell.

"my experience was great, but now it just feels washed out. I played since version 1.0. The DPS powercreep has gone off the deep end. If you play any characters released during 1.x version, you will have a worser, harder experience, and it's only 3.0. Many characters are filled with abilities that do nothing (arlan), or have essential abilities for a good strategy locked behind multiple copies. Buffers keep one uping each other to the point they all do the same thing, but better every release.",2,2025-04-10 09:02:36

But ever since the global passive was leaked and made it to live, it doesn't even feel nice even after I got Castorice because I didn't want to waste my work. Call me a hypocrite for having Castorice sure, but I still hate the global passive and how predatory it was. I was going to pull for her not for the global passive, but because I liked her.

"This game doesn't respect their players' time and pretends to listen to any feedback given. Powercreep is rampant, the characters you pulled a few patches ago will be inferior when the newer character comes, the new endgame will always be tailored to the most busted character (a.k.a the new unit) Yet the devs think it'll be okay to put buffs that are active even when the character is not in the team on a LIMITED CHARACTER. There's also a lack of chara expressions and BAD storytelling.",1,2025-04-10 00:32:57

"Big change from my past review, the game has significantly decreased in quality in terms of fun and effort in my opinion. Firstly the story-wise has become a yapfest with all of the filler and unskippable dialogue, could use more poses for the characters instead of just having like 3 emotes, could also use more cutscenes or pictures for better immersion. Secondly powercreep is a big issue, 1.X characters are practically unusable and HP inflation is comparable to inflation irl",1,2025-04-09 19:10:41

Used to be my favourite but thanks to HP inflation. characters which I used to love have become useless. they can't even clear normal mobs properly not to mention bosses.

"global passive is a big concern when it comes to gatcha games. It is basically insentivizing players to pull for a character that has a global passive even if they don't want that Character, because if they don't pull for it then they won't be at the same as those who pull for it, especially now that the end game content like MoC having Hp inflation and you need the latest characters to beat it",1,2025-04-09 18:02:45

ngl was one of my fave games but then the newest released character - Castorice. she was the developers' answer to the insane powercreep of older characters by the new one: just make one that can't be powercreeped at all! ;; the global passive makes it seem like Castorice HAS to be pulled and you know what i'll be happy to do that but at least try to give enough pulls so you can get her! for a no spender this game can be very harsh.,1,2025-04-09 17:55:25

"This is a great game (in the past). I like this game, really really like it. This game once had a great story, challenging gameplay, and loveable character. I played (almost) all Hoyo games, this game once to be my most beloved game. Now it has become a chore, money grabber, and lazy storytelling. I really feel betrayed. Already uninstall it. If you wanna try it, just play it till you clear Belobog. It doesn't matter how long nor how much money you spent, your chars are gonna be obsolete. Bye",1,2025-04-09 17:41:26
The story has gotten worse since Belobog. Over time the power creep has become more & more extreme so f2p and low-spending have a harder time beating end game. we now have p2w global passives. 3.0 kinda sucks ngl. forced to pull 2 to 3 copies of a character for them to be enjoyable & there are rumours that an upcoming character will need their lightcone or they'll be mostly useless. Lack of meaningful events/events in general (there's maybe two or three per patch). 50% of cast has no eng VA's.,1,2025-04-09 17:39:09
"the story is AMAZING and i would say i like this game more than genshin edit: I'm so disappointed in this game ngl, powercreep is CRAZY, hp inflation is craaaazy and you can't beat most end game stuff without pulling for the latest character unless you put CRAZYYY investment into a character. genuinely insane how everyone glazes this game over genshin, yes genshin has its flaws, but this game also has aspects where it's so much worse.",1,2025-04-09 17:36:40

"Holy power creep is this a mess of a game. Want global passives? Want gambling? Go right ahead. Play. It is still a very fun game - but ONLY when playing f2p and casually. If you don't spend money or don't chase the meta - DO NOT EXPECT TO DO WELL. This game is either expensive in monetary means, or in temporal means. Do not play this game expecting to clear everything. Play it to enjoy the story. This review will remain one star as the downsides are just so overwhelning compared to the upsides.",1,2025-04-09 15:06:12
"since a while it's become clear that the developers care more about squeezing every last penny out of the userbase than anything else. It's sort of fine if you've been playing for a while and can keep up, but I honestly can't recommend star rail for new players at this point",2,2025-04-09 15:01:49
This game has given me more agony than I would like to admit. Truly an expensive game to play in terms of money as well as time and effort. Characters get replaced every few patches and there's no stopping. The story is good but if you like a character you will have to engage with endgame or you'd have to pay to get them.,1,2025-04-09 15:01:07

"I have been playing this game since launch. I love turn based rpgs and this is a beautiful game with a good story. I usually pay the 4.99 and 9.99 monthly passes. It is not necessary to spend money but without a couple top tier characters, end game content will be a challenge. Until recently I felt the $15 a month I was spending gave me worth while perks. I had been saving for around 6 months for the character Casterice and spent over 50k shards and tickets, over 300 pulls. This is hundreds",4,2025-04-09 11:43:31
"release two 5 stars every patch little to no 4stars powercreep (global revive? why?) character kits locked behind dupes or lightcone(weapon) trash storytelling (blackscreen , verbal diarrhea, 0 animations, missing VAs, 0 effort) 0 content ( after clearing biweekly endgame there's literally nothing to do ) garbage events (either you get low effort 40minutes clicking autoplay events or nothing) Just EOS and refund if give such garbage low effort content please. it's so insulting.",1,2025-04-09 11:43:30
"yo, I love this game and I still do, but as an f2p player the powercreep and hp inflation is just too much. and the fact that the last 4 star that was released was back in september is insane. plus, with the new castorice global passive it's not looking too good. seriously hoyoverse, if you're gonna add 5 stars left and right atleast give us more rewards. the burnout be going crazy with this one lol.",2,2025-04-09 11:40:47

"Absolutely love this game, The trailblazers are funny as hell and the game is unhinged while still following the storyline. I didn't know if I would like the turn based RPG style but I really love it. Very f2p friendly, I have not spent a single dime on this game and yet I have some cracked characters. Main story Gameplay is perfect, it's not so easy that you can blow through it but not hard enough to the point it becomes frustrating, and the amount of endgame content is noice, 100% must play!",5,2025-04-09 11:40:24

"Intense Powercreep and old characters are really hard to get. I used to really love this game because some characters have an engaging story that made players love the characters even more. however, it seems like those characters are no longer a priority to the developer, not saying that new characters are bad, it's just that there's no point in playing and cashing in (this is unnecessary but when you love a character, you tend to invest in it more) when your favorites isn't relevant anymore",1,2025-04-09 11:33:21

"As a Honkai game, HSR follows the tradition of insane powercreep and copious amounts of dialogue loaded with science jargons and stuff you probably don't care enough to dive into.

"I loved this game from the start. The characters, the lore, the setting, the turn-based combat, pretty much everything. But with the direction that the game is going, I feel like my love for it is starting to fade. The powercreep and the incentive to pull the newest units is just terrible. Old characters are left in a ditch and barely do anything against new endgame unless you invest to the max. That's why I've decided to quit.

Serious and interesting story, rewarding, fun, relaxing. And it runs so good on phone as well. Both PC and mobile version plays perfectly without any issue. Edit : The game meta system is in shambles, HP inflation of enemies is out of control, and the end game is not F2P or low spender friendly anymore.",3,2025-04-09 11:09:45
"Hoyoverse just released a very gay, very white, and most redundantly, a very powerful trailblazer. Castorice has singlehandedly reduced gacha content creators to tears, evaporated friendships, and repelled the invasion of tourists to the anime mobile gaming genre. I am astonished that Homoverse was able to create a trailblazer that could attempt to approach the omni-potent Silverwolf in terms of setting a new precedent.

The story is dull and boring every version and it seems to keep getting worse and becoming unbearable. the worst part is that every version now seems to introduce more limited time characters and that these characters need the next limited character to buff up with no other substitute and it only keeps getting worse. the endgame content has reached a point where it requires more than limited time characters or their signature's and require all of them to be a limited characters to clear anything,1,2025-04-09 08:52:56

"I love the animations in this game, furthermore many people complain about powercrept but hsr is giving a lot of rewards. Games like genshin where old characters can still clear the spiral abyss doesn't need to give much rewards as the number of 5 star released is lesser. Hsr has had two new 5 stars in one update. so u can't like completely complain on powercrept.

"overall the game is great but the powercreep is just insane, i know games can have better characters overtime as the game unlocks more and more features but why every single patch? suddenly the strongest character of the patch becomes weak and unplayable 5 months later. imagine the people who spend so much money on them! compared to your other games like genshin, who still has old characters that can clear the abyss, the only powercreep there is is just exploration powercreep, anything else nah",3,2025-04-08 22:44:31

"For prospective new players, be warned they are now starting to introduce account-wide buffs tied into limited/gacha character kits. What this means is your active 4-person team will be buffed by an inactive character outside of that team. This addition was neither desired nor necessary. It solves no problem. All it adds is increased fomo via a buff system that forever affect past and future characters. The door's now open. The precedent is set. Start playing at your own risk.",2,2025-04-08 21:41:09

"the game just became more pay to win with the new update, making bosses have an unjustified high HP forcing players to pull certain characters just to do enough damage to clear the end game. especially now with castorice's universal passive, making your character reject death.

"there are WAYS you could make this game better designed: 1. keep the difficulty of MOC the same until floor 12, BUT keeps increasing it as you add more level/floor to the MOC (more rewards too). this way the older unit will not get powercrept easily 2. make global passive something more story gated (same concept as you progress to unlock more passive for the SU/DU) 3.

"Rating this 2 stars lower than I initially did purely because of HP inflation and the predatory monetisation and horrid f2p experience. I have 2 accounts 1 F2P and one very much p2p, the f2p account is doing fine but I have played since the game came out on both accounts. Now days I cannot see the game being easy to get in to due to how little the game wants to give you in terms of free resources vs how much the game requires you to grow in strength to keep up with end game content.",2,2025-04-08 16:16:20

We got global passives before char buffs so you can see the devs are money hungry. The constant need to pull for new characters to stay competitive is frustrating and makes the game a cash grab.

"So here are my thoughts after 2 years of playing this game: 1. Meta: Meta rotations are too fast, if you want to stay relevant you should pull a new character so you will find it easily difficult to clear some content. 2. Story: The story is full of yapping, ngl even the easiest thing like ""drink"" is narrated in BLACK SCREEN HOW TF IN THE WORLD YOU USE THAT INSTEAD ANIMATE THAT?! 3. Balancing: You will find it easy to find out that the enemies by the time their HP greatly increases.",1,2025-04-08 06:18:33

the powercreep in this game becoming more and more unbearable.

Powercreep is necessary as the game grows, but not in such a rush, where are you guys going with this? if you guys want to sell more 5-stars then it's not helping at all.

First of all, imagine having to pull for newer characters just to clear an endgame mode that when cleared, only gives you a miniscule amount of currency that is so low compared to the amount of currency you spend on the character that you just recently pulled. Also the fact that some QoL are still not here despite it being version 3.X (e.g. Artifact Loadouts, Eidolon Toggle) is quite baffling to us day 1 players. ü•±",1,2025-04-06 12:30:31

Between the obvious favoritism of certain characters, the HP inflation with each new patch to blatantly powercreep older units, the lopsided elemental coverage between genders, and now the introduction of predatory global passives.

"Amazing game slowly turned into a roulette machine. The numbers just started getting bigger and bigger yet you, the player, are still losing. A good story isn't the only thing a story-driven rpg game needs. there's a lack of balance to the point of buffs being useless, horrible storytelling where they literally use black screens with text, and no skip button which means you have to sit through too many dialogue.",1,2025-04-05 15:30:58

I enjoyed it when I started but it's a hard game to play for a long time. I played for over a year and like every event we get is just story and they're sooo long. The main quest was amazing but again I don't wanna do like a 6 to 8 hour quest every patch. It got boring after awhile and more of a chore than having fun. So not for me.,1,2025-04-05 15:08:57

"Game went down into sever powercreep, anti consumerism and predatory business tactics very quickly over the last year. Most characters will be powercreept within a few updates of their release. Yet there are still 2 new 5* every update. While barley any 4* units are being released. And on top of that Castorice will introduce global passives into the game, making the balancing of the game even more miserable for f2ps. Furthermore the game is lacking content and has rather poor storytelling.",1,2025-04-04 16:13:23

Oh how the mighty have fallen. This game was something I played very frequently since global launch . But with the recent attitude the Dev's have towards their game it's final nail in the coffin. How much more will u break the game's core mechanics ( especially in turn based game btw) just to sell a powerful character. Powercreep is insane. Now with the upcoming update u don't even need to have the new char in ur team cuz they make ur entire account better just by getting them . Predatory Asf,1,2025-04-04 15:47:48

If i could rate this a zero i would. This game has had a powercreep issue for over a year now and new characters dont even last 3 months till they are powercrept again. The difficulty is skyrocketing and unless you have thousands of dollars. this game is jusy unplayable cuz you will fall behind so badly. i use to love this game but since 2.6 its only been getting worse and aftrr 3.0 we were given a false promise tht theyd fix the game by 3.2 only for them to make it worse. Im done waiting.,1,2025-04-04 08:20:43

"Lack of real events or things to do makes the game boring after you've completed the story for the patch. HP keeps going up which ties to an issue of powercreep.

As it will punish players- old and new, who hasn't pulled to the recent character at the latest patches as the mechanics tend to lean towards them at its favor.",1,2025-04-03 04:55:00
"The absurd HP inflation and blatant powercreep of characters, it's difficult to play older characters. The enemies I used to defeat with older characters now have absurd HP bar in the end game. Even mobs have too much HP. With the anniversary coming, the game feels like more of a Pay-to-win with the release of new limited characters left and right. With the release of global passive, the developer's greediness surfaces. What's the use of Silverwolf when Anaxa blatantly powercreep her. Thank you",1,2025-04-03 04:54:33

As of 3.2 they decided to add global passives that will open the door for heavy power-creep since you will need to get characters you don't like because otherwise your account is worse than those that have characters with global passives. Storytelling is very poorly executed due to interactions with bad looking and not interesting NPCs and important bits of story are done through PNGs (such as Mydei backstory) which takes alot of the interest in the game.,1,2025-04-03 00:08:52

"played this game months ago and genuinely compared to its genshin (same company mind you), the power creep is ridiculous. you wanna play an old character? have fun not being able to clear end game content. The hell were they thinking making a character that can revive you without being on the team to begin with? I agree it's generous and has BEAUTIFUL designs but it's clear they're after money and money only and it's so sad seeing the devs waste the insane potential HSR has",1,2025-04-01 22:21:59
No care for player experience,1,2025-04-01 22:21:58
"It actually has a good story-telling and gameplay, along with its turn-based. The only problem about this game is the power creep where the old 5* are getting benched or not getting used as much as the new ones. I suggest that you do some balancing for the characters also rather than just adding more 5* characters and making the old ones not used. For example, buffs and nerfs or balances, don't just focus on buffs, it'll still probably ruin the game or still power creep some 5* characters.",5,2025-04-01 22:21:45

Gosh this way you treat a f2p i can't clear some end game content without using meta char. What the heck the global passive castorice not even a emanator you making big mistake here making people to get her to just get passive that affected all game content. Gezz the old 5 star characters now useless making them standard not get idea just buff them like match scaling of new char ugh im talking about seele and dhil. You guys better made sw great now. I'm very disappointed as v1.0 player.,1,2025-04-01 21:38:38
This is the most frustrating gacha I have ever played. the most egregious power creep for every new character they release. a disproportionate distribution between male and female playable characters. Their choices now should really make people reflect on whether this is a company they should be supporting.,1,2025-04-01 21:38:01
"The game was good, emphasis on was. There are some promises on improvements but they feel rather empty as of late. I'd describe the game as killed by 1000 cuts where i kept overlooking small things until that's all that remaindled of the experience. Powercreep, bad storrytelling, bad story alltogether, unwanted mechanics, and ignoring player feedback. I would suggest playing just for the story but even that took a nosedive in 2.3, and it only kept getting worse from there.",1,2025-04-01 21:36:28

i think the recent update has brought hsr to a new low 1. global passives is a really bad and predatory on that in future it'll get worse 2. barely any events like 3 events isn't enough dude there is already nothing to do in the game 3. powercreep keeps getting worse look at anaxa 4.story is really good but the telling please for the love of god improve it add more emotions and expression to the characters when telling the story you can afford it 5. no new end game since AS (not counting SU),1,2025-04-01 16:28:39

Every patch, game releases 2 5-stars, and seldomly releases 4-stars. HP boss inflation is hard to keep up. It is so bad that it can pressure players to do invest more just to increase their units' shell life. Story is boring. It's filled with heavy exposition with no skip button.

Honkai used to be the favorite of the hoyoverse games because how they worked with their community to make a great game for the player base but I guess they just got greedy.

"I played for quite a while and enjoyed the game until Penacony. Ever since they introduced Super Break, everything went downhill with the enemy power scales and character power creep. the characters I built up became useless and I don't want to waste my time with this game anymore. With 3.0's release, everything crashed as in with my outdated character and disgustingly casual game time (play once a week or so), I can't catch up and can't complete any endgame for resources. So yeah, it ain't good",1,2025-04-01 14:01:57
"The 3.2 update is the worst. You try to cover it by giving out free 30 pulls and a free limited char but thats not gonna work. Global passive is just one of your dirty trick to make us pull the char. The amphoreus story is bland, long and complicated. The latest divergent universe is suck cuz of the pointless day and night mechanic and it also based on luck. Older char will be buffed in 3.4, I don't think it will fixed the issue of powercreep. Moc buff now only works for new char.",1,2025-04-01 14:00:00

"This is the year I'm finally dropping this game, thanks to them doubling down on powercreeping characters with the introduction of global passive. Which basically buffs your gameplay by simply having that character in your account. At that point, it's no longer about mix and matching teams, it's about who you have in your account. Not to mention the lackluster presentation in the story telling that has not improved since the game's release. Avoid.",1,2025-04-01 13:45:08

"Love the characters, love the world design. My fave game that hoyo has created. Although I must admit that power creep has became ridiculous since 1.0 . About the global passive, I have no problem about it overall but my only issue is that the global passive still activates when the character isn't even in the team slot. This also implies that you guys' will make bosses or even world monsters even more powerful and may potentially end our team way faster than before. It's unnecessary.",3,2025-04-01 13:35:44
Stop making the difference between the old units vs newer units that much farther. You're forcing the players to be at least low spender just to have a decent time in the game. This is predatory business practices.,1,2025-04-01 13:30:23
"this game looks good at the first glance, but if you've been playing this game for quite a long time, you will likely notice this game flaws. Here's the predictable recurring flaws that I despise: 1. Favoritism only to certain characters and sidelined other characters. This means, ""favorite"" characters get enough contents, but sidelined characters will get lesser contents. 2. This game forces you to pull newest characters to clear endgame content. 3.

"Stop shoving girl characters in our faces despite the story focus isn't about her. I liked Castorice before you shoved her into our faces.

Now, with global passive coming, even if a character releases that's bad, or you have 0 interest in, but has a global passive you deem necessary, you will have to pull for them.... this is something I have 0 interest in participating in, I love beating end game content with just the characters I want.",1,2025-04-01 09:20:59

Castorice PROS: -Good Character Story/Trailer -Global Revive -Tier 0 DPS -Huge investment to player's account CONS: -Breaks the essence & balance of the combat mechanics -Endgame difficulty increases to counter global passive -Account is bricked without her. -Forced to save when F2P and couldn't obtain her. Waiting time could take months. -Enables future global passive that forces player to pull even though they don't want them.,1,2025-04-01 08:55:26

But powercreep has gotten out of hand with how fast characters need to be replaced, which feels extra bad with how long they take to build (worst gearing system compared to Genshin or Zenless) The recently announced ""global passive"" was my breaking point.

Predatory game. Old characters aren't viable anymore. every endgame is catered towards the new character. The gacha system is just awful with its low rates on getting the desired character/weapon A global passive is tied to a limited Character that can change the flow of battle.

It feels as if I'm being constantly nudged to make in-app purchases so that I'm not left in the dust, making the prospect of shiny new characters less enjoyable than anything. It's a shame...",1,2025-04-01 02:23:40

day 1 player who dropped the game during 3.0. powercreep has ruined the game. unless your a whale spender or only play for story and don't care about missing rewards from end game content just stay away. global passives will also slowly kill this game along with the powercreep. hoyo doesn't listen to feedback either. use to love this game but no longer.,1,2025-04-01 02:04:22
"nothing new or original (copies a lot iconic moments from other series without making it fresh & original). reboxes HI3rd plot than full recycling into something new.

"This game becomes more thirsty for money. It's slowly turning to a P2W. With every update, they will powercreep old characters with new characters, effectively forcing us to pull for characters we don't want. Sure, they have better treatment for rewards and all, but it's not worth the effort and time for the amount of pulls we have to make just to clear endgame contents. The amount of rewards are not even enough for every forced pull. And I don't want the global passive, Hoyo. Boring...",1,2025-04-01 00:21:58

"It used to be a great side gacha game with contents filled with passion in the early patches, but the game hit steady decline in quality for main story quest and events from patch 2.4 until the patch 3.1 when this review released. The game is kinda okay if you play it really casually as a side gacha and don't mind the occasional content drought. The daily is quick and the events are easy. But I suggest look elsewhere if you want something more because the game don't and won't offer much gameplay",3,2025-04-01 00:17:29

at first it's so good i enjoy the game since 2.4 i like to turn bass the combat but i like an open world i stop playing hsr in 2.6 and i return in 2.7 and they said the worst update of all time is 2.6 but now it is shaping up a new worst patch starting in 3.2 hopefully in the next patch will good not just like 3.2 that having a lot of controversy,2,2025-03-31 19:05:23

OVERALL: still recommended cause to me this is the best game Hoyo can offer. But for a billion dollar company, they are spending less to the production as game gets older.

This game is visually great but after 2 years it is clear that the game will end service soon with the decisions the development team are making. greedy for money and that is reflected in the Health inflation in end game so you spend that coin in the new characters or you are left behind because you simply can't clear end game.

Honkai Star Rail recently introduced a mechanic that basically will force you to pull for new characters for buffs that are given to any of your future teams and characters. This is very unhealthy and will force you to pull for characters you may not want but need to play all the content in the game. Due to this the game is in a bad spot and is currently not worth playing unless these passives are given in a different way. I do not recommend playing unless you don't mind being forced to pull,1,2025-03-31 14:51:34

"latest review: (played for 445 days) this game has become a playground for the pay to win kinda players who can spend more. They are pushing player away by reducing the number of events available and the Power creep problem is real. this game is predatory rn. If you are new then try other games not this one. 1st review: (Gigguk introduced me to this game and I love it soooo much, I have lil Geppie but i am waiting to get Seeleüíú)",2,2025-03-31 09:55:25

"such an amazing game. the story started out weak, but has only gotten better since Penacony onward. voice acting and writing have had a massive jump in quality, too! the new character Castorice has this global buff to your team that adds another layer of strategy and depth to the combat. I can't wait to pull her! Thank you, Hoyoverse! I love what you do!",5,2025-03-31 09:49:45
"I really don't recommend this game. It's going in a really bad Direction like having global passives on characters. So if you didn't pull for that character, your account is objectively worse off The level of power creep in this game is insane. They would release a character and then four to six patches later release another character that does the same thing the first one did but better",1,2025-03-31 09:48:21
"This game used to be awesome, but that's no longer the case. The powercreep has become way too much for casuals, the story has become a snooze fest since 2.6, no skip button forces you to slowly and painfully watch a bunch of text over and over and makes you hate the game you once loved. The devs have become greedy in a outstanding way. Basically every move they make is to drain the players off they money.",1,2025-03-31 09:45:52

The best story driven gacha on the market period. The gameplay is simple but very satisfying and f2p friendly as the only incentive to pull is for characters and playstyles that you like. - This how I rated the game in 2023. I'm not even going to pretend any of this applies anymore. I still enjoy the gameplay but the greed of this company is simply outrageous. I can't in good faith rate the game any higher than 1 star.,1,2025-03-31 09:07:45

"There's a lot to like about HSR but over time all the non-story content has become so tailored to promotion whatever limited character that despite owning most of the characters + good gear I still can't fully beat it. Also there are a lot of decisions that feel unnecessarily hostile to the player, which force you to farm way more than would be necessary.

Yes, the characters are being powercrept and the relic system sucks (as always) but I still get to beat enemies in good time with Jing Yuan (reason I played). Love the Amphoreus arc, so much better than Penacony. MC has hilarious lines, Mem is adorable, and as a husbando-collector, I'm satisfied.

"I used to like the game as a newer version of FGO, but over time the story becomes convoluted (not sure where they are going with the story now), and the in-game lore is harder to follow. Powercreep to some degree is understandable but they are a bit too late buffing older characters. And I'm not in favor of global passive.",3,2025-03-31 06:29:59
"The game is great with its gameplay and story wise although it's not particularly enjoyable if you don't have well built characters as you progress through it,especially for upcoming patches, building wise for the characters is circled round luck which is pure garbage mechanic since you need to invest loads of time and patience.

"No gameplay only dialogue. Too much powercreep. Game is only for those who earns six figures. Not for everyone. Express supply pass is nothing, it's just throwing money to the fire to be burned to ashes and get nothing. You need like 1000-2000$ if you want some significant changes on your characters. I don't really care about the story even if it's really bad cause i only want gameplay. The devs should make a novel instead.

Despite the recent issues with the English voice actors striking to protect them selves from AI and subsequent studio change. Honkai Star Rail is a fun RPG set in a futuristic world where people have spread out all across the cosmos. The story is so rich with enjoyable twists and turns as well as amazing characters to back up it's already great story. Each character truly feels like it's own person and despite its focus on meta and money (like all gacha games) you can't help but play more.,5,2025-03-30 14:40:59

Of course like every game it had its ups and downs but I still enjoyed logging in and playing my 30 min daily. But after the 3.2 Live I can say the Devs slapped us in the face with big floppy Dongs and expected us to thank them.

It's sad to see a game that I like slowly kill itself because the devs are so eager to push through with powercreep that we don't need. If they ever want to implement powercreep they could do so in a way that doesn't make everyone abandon old units for new ones especially with the global passives. If they ever wish to go forward with this they might as well implement global passives for every other character released prior to Castorice to keep things fair but knowing Hoyo they probably wouldn't.,1,2025-03-30 06:41:00

How can a game about team building have characters that support the team but not being on the team? Someone make that make sense to me. What a joke. Not to mention still no qol (story skips).

Been playing since day 1 but its just gotten terrible due the shill hoyo fans. Almost nothing ever actally happens to characters in the story and the game balance is broken. Most characters and items are useless. If you perfer to use characters you like over characters that are strong this isnt the game for you.

Doubled down on all the scum. Just nonchalantly spoke of the global passive and quickly moved on. Tried damage control and didn't disclose any details on the character reworks just told of it to keep the players on the hook. Still refuse to add a skip button( a qol already in the game but locked behind repeat dialogue). Even disclosure of the free 5* to keep the players on and waiting for it while completely destroying the game stat.

Not only this, the fact that Hoyo is willing to put a GLOBAL PASSIVE just for pulling a character sets a predatory precedent for future characters. Sure, a revive is nothing now, but wait until we get a character that buffs SPD just for having them in your account.

Spent $600 on this game and can't clear content to the fullest. My units feel weaker because of the HP inflation and restrictive buffs. Game moved from turned based rpg gacha to just a gacha game. Selling you full teams but no compensation - decent f2p options for the new Remeberance path and Acheron. Have to pull for signatures now for most of these units. Storytelling is terrible but the lore is good. Barely any content & fast powecreep.,2,2025-03-29 02:43:09

"yeah this game is cooked, they don't know how to balance their character and now we haven't seen a new affordable 4 star. if you consider playing this game, run. this game became more and more money hungry towards their player, i play for 2+ year and the shift meta was very subtle. they bring a strong character that makes old character struggling to keep up because they need to raise the enemy scale so that the new character can't one shot the character. keep raise the number and lack creativity",1,2025-03-28 15:00:40
"Powercreep & hp inflation is crazy , also it's almost impossible to pull for new units every patch for f2ps/casual players as the powercreep trend continues. The buffs we get for the end game are extremely catered towards the new units . Greedy company ruined another awesome game . Just all around disgusting. Rating: ( 0/10 )would not recommend",1,2025-03-28 14:54:35
"Fell in love with game at launch. Sad that only roughly two years later it has gone bad. Hp inflation rather than meaningful mechanics. Story that just feels half assed with black screens, no dynamic camera and only two poses for every character. Current story is just info dump after info dump after info dump with a few character moments here and there. Two stars just for what it used to be.",2,2025-03-28 14:51:25
"The game is fun. I love the storyline and animation. Very lively. But it is very not F2P. Once you get the character you wanted, the character might not be used as patches later due to powercreep. You need to force yourself to get a new character and End games are the evidence. Compared to Genshin, my old characters are still useful until now. Hope this can change",4,2025-03-28 14:51:00
"As someone who played from the start of this game's release, I feel like the powercreep is getting more ridiculous each time there is an update. The fact that they have more 5 stars than 4 stars also sums it. I also don't get the mistreatment this game gives to male characters. They deserve some love too. Giving one star until our voice is heard, or I will consider uninstalling and play other games instead.",1,2025-03-28 14:48:50

"At the current state of the game, I really don't think it measures up to the success it has. The game barely has content and it's been painfully obvious that this game turned into the devs self insert game where they overtune the hell out of their waifus. I can't see a future where they actually put effort again in this game and hopefully something will happen that will set them straight.",1,2025-03-28 14:41:33
"Powercreep is insane. Old 5* limited units are now useless, and there are multiple 5* reruns for each patch, with a new 5*. No four stars have been released for months now. Very greedy. If you're new and f2p expect your team to hit like a wet noodle.",2,2025-03-28 14:32:21
"It crushes me to realize I hate this game now. I genuinely loved it so much but the more it updates the more despicable it becomes. The new characters make my hard work building my old ones feel useless. The new updates aren't fun, there's no new events, there's no character quests. It feels like playable content is locked behind a paywall. It feels so greedy and scummy, and now I don't even get to hear my fave voices. At least WuWa gives me free characters, compensation, and events.",1,2025-03-28 14:32:11
"I love this game. I play it for the characters, their personalities and their lore. I love being a Trailblazer! With that in mind, I play for the characters- and with a lack of open-world exploration, and many cutscenes being idle animation and voice versus dynamic, their dialogue and voice lines mean a LOT to the experience of the game. I cannot morally support a game that will get rid of voice actors, REAL people, because they don't want to be impersonated by AI. Artists support ALL artists!",2,2025-03-28 14:32:08
"this is getting too much! im playing this game since 1.0 and the powercrept is so fast, like it started in 2.x patches ig. the rewards aren't enough for the f2p players bcs it can't be clear in easy way, its not a skill issue bcs farming relics and mats is a problem too. adding a three rerun banners with a new limited character is insane, just imagine how we can get what we want. instead, it will be a need to pull just for the meta. please make it more balance in terms of rewards and characters.",1,2025-03-28 14:31:44

In game content wise they have been very lacking in events, that after you complete the story after a week its another 5 weeks of just waiting for the new patch, and to excel further in the game you'd require characters that are mostly 5 stars to make them synergies with each other with less options for 4 stars that can clear end game content.

"Gacha rates aren't as bad as genshin but roll for who your favorite character is. I am strictly f2p and this main story game is doable if you know how to build your characters. The grind levels cost a lot of stamina and it is only enough for 10 minutes of gameplay. Grinding for materials is kinda boring but having auto battle makes it manageable.

What used to be a really interesting game with decent story telling and somewhat stakes turned into a Disney series.

"This game was great the first year and even into 2.0 besides power creep but I cannot advise anyone to play it right now if you really want to get immersed into it. It's a pretty predatory gacha at this point. Very few events/character focused content and things to do in general (all there is DU, sometimes a end-game content refresh and pulling), too many black screen with white text over animation/art, and Hoyo itself keeps replacing va's rather than finding a solution to keep them.",1,2025-03-28 05:35:47
"I loved HSR at release and during the first year. The game seemed so fun back then with character hangouts, interactive events, and amazing characters. Ever since then HSR has been on a constant decline. The predatory gacha is worse than any other gacha games, it's a barrage of 5* characters, the events are far spaced out and there's some new level of endgame hell.

Powercreep to the point where pulling for characters that are released 6 months ago is pointless. Dialogue is so bloated the main quest takes up 10 hours of your time.

"I've been playing it for like 3 months and all i wanna say is, this game is Amazing but I would recommend doing something for low end phones players. like there's some sort of sky rendering issue in my game and no matter what I did its not loading instead it has become like a TV when u don't have signal like jiggling in blue light.",3,2025-03-25 02:04:23

"used to be good, but the constant powercreep is crazy",3,2025-03-24 23:02:45
I would give it 1 star just for graphics and gameplay style cause I literally agree with other reviews that recent updates are making each character powercreep like unless you don't have these you can't keep up with the content and the bosses and game modes where enemies hp is increased only because of the recent powercreep when I installed I liked this game and deleted this after the recent updates.Additionally the pity system is making me loose more frequently .,1,2025-03-24 22:57:22

I reroll a lot to pull for different characters in different accounts, but because of the dialogues, my patience runs out before I could even finish the tutorial. I have already finished the story, so I would appreciate it if I don't have to go through the story again and just skip all of the dialogues. This would be very helpful.",1,2025-03-24 16:48:07

I am pretty new to this game and it has really good graphics and ideas. it has some long dialogues and texts to go through but it is kinda necessary for the experience . new characters with really great designs and personalities that I liked and despite people nagging about how they don't like where the game is going it's just their overly unachievable expectations. but I still love the game though the issue with ho inflation in end game content is kinda hard to ignore,5,2025-03-24 07:08:32

"After playing this game for over a year I must express my disappointment for the direction the gameplay is taking. 1) HP-Inflation: clearing endgame content without the latest meta character is nearly impossible. 2) Bias for female characters: male characters are not as strong or have lazier animations. Just look at upcoming characters Castorice and Anaxa. Anaxa has repeated animations! Depsite having a lackluster kit at best, he got nerfed to smithereens in V6! Blatant bias is being shown here.",1,2025-03-23 15:55:58

The primary issue for me is that the rates are very rough and Hoyo likes to release characters that syergize well with each other very close to each other making it extremely difficult to build a proper team around your favorite characters. I prefer to play how I want with who I want and still make progress but it is quite difficult with HSR.

And please buff older characters like you said so, not indirectly but directly. Also, the trace or character materials, I think it would be better to increase drop rates of 4* mats at final levels.

"I enjoyed this game until its weird account level gatekeeping killed the fun. I was having fun doing the main story, but then suddenly while you're in the middle of the story it just abruptly interrupts you to tell you to go grind side quests and dailies before you're allowed to progress the story, because your account level isn't high enough. Really immersion breaking and completely kills the fun. Makes the game suddenly feel like homework. I immediately uninstalled.",2,2025-03-23 01:41:51

I love the game but Jesus christ if you are interested in the story you will read more than you read in university. The story is long and most of the time it has so much useless information it's insane. I feel I am reading more than I am playing. Relic farming is insanely boring and rng is always against you.

"This game used to be one of my favorite gacha games but it seems like it's just going downhill. With the more recent 3.0 story updates, it just feels like the story has pointless filler to pad out the run time. It's a JRPG, it should be up to the player to pad out the run time by doing side quests, not the main story. Grinding for materials/relics needs to be reworked. It's taking too long with luck based dropped. That should be the gacha, not equipment. Silent English dub is a bad sign too.",3,2025-03-21 21:01:43

I loved this game all the way through v2 but the enemy HP bloat and the absolute NEED for the newest character to clear the endgame means your 100-300 dollar character is not going to perform the way you'd expect such an investment to do so.

First, the skip button, it's nothing serious if you want to read the story but with how the characters repeat what the others just said I would want a skip option. Not to mention the event stories. Second, the ""gameplay"". There's nothing, really, anything worthwhile playing this game for the gameplay. And with the recent update, powercreep is not the only thing you would worry about.

"Very predatory and not in a good place. 90% of events are dull and the other 10% are mediocre. If you want to clear lategame content with your favourite team that isn't 'the current thing', spend money. Story is all filler until a cutscene that hypes up the climax and then more filler. You can find better stories in the side quest then the main story, and even then it's nothing that special. Spend money or play for months to get a team that will be mediocre in a couple months (sometimes sooner).",1,2025-03-20 22:05:01

It didnt even let me play as it kept kicking me out the app. Please get this fixed because i know damn well its not my phones fault,1,2025-03-15 16:23:20

"2025 Edit: The game is worth playing up until 3.0. After GI, I can safely say this is where the game goes into ""maintenance"" mode and doesn't innovate, expand, or explore. Hope I'm wrong, but waiting 3+ months for a game to maybe get good is insane. A fantastic game. The second story arc is weak, but the events and gameplay are phenomenal and the voice acting is stellar. Leaps and bounds better than GI in terms of QoL and improvements.",3,2025-03-15 14:30:25

"The game progresses far too fast for a modern gacha, power creeping every 2 months. They're also trying to add a new global passive mechanic, which will only drive them further down a hole. The game needs to fix itself before people start quitting more than they already are.",1,2025-03-11 09:46:24

Game has a massive powercreep problem that forces you to pull as many units as you can. Enemies have an allarmingly exponential HP growth with proggressively more stally mechanics because the endgame mode wants you to finish stages as fast as possible. Endgame is an endless amount of HP sponge enemies (3-4 million HP) who dopotato damage to you and just want to stall you out. Play this game for story and characters not for gameplay. Community may try to deny it but the game's direction is bad,1,2025-03-11 02:58:41

If you skip the story, don't do it, it's not even fun, then try making a slot for the relic/planar set so you can change it, it's not complicated and the same is true in the team change section, like in Zzz, you can save the team so it's easier and the relic bag fills up faster so please increase the relic thank you",5,2025-03-10 09:35:30

You'll make way more money with paid skins than you would by trying to force players into rolling for the newest characters out of necessity. If someone has been playing since launch they probably like the characters. If you make all the characters that someone fell in love with useless, then they will most likely quit. Skins wins.

- Very money greedy. Cannot max star newest endgame content (like Apocalyptic Shadow or Memory of Chaos) without pulling for all newest characters (and most of their light cones). - Pretty boring.

Fix your game. Story is boring and just keep introducing 100 characters with shallow story writing. Every shiny new character powercreeps the previous every single patch.

It's been a while since I played because of storage bloat (hopefully those at Hoyo can find a way to compact it) but from what I remember it is a lot of fun!

The game is fun. The gameplay is turn based mixed with some world exploration as well as fun minigames and sidequests. The characters are funny. Performance has started to get a little worse. I do have to sadly admit the game is starting to get a little boring. The latest quests just didn't get my attention as much as when Penacony was first introduced.

Unfortunately, recently, with new game modes and characters, I find the game to be life sucking and boring. It honestly feels like you NEED specific characters to pass some areas, no room for characters you actually like. The constant power-creep is also so tiring, no room to save for characters. I uninstalled and don't plan on playing again.",1,2025-03-03 00:18:05
Was a great game now just average as the power creep and predatory gatcha with limited currency is a thing in this game.,4,2025-03-02 23:30:05
"This game has the best lore out of any Hoyoverse game. Love the sci-fi space and divine power anime theme with bits of modern humor sprinkled in. Furthermore, this game has the best lore delivery because it is a turn-based battle system with room-based exploration, which makes the long dialogue blend in with everything else. If it were ""open world"" or an ""action RPG,"" then the long lore and dialogue would seem out of place from the open exploration or intense combat. Excellent job üëç",5,2025-03-02 23:10:12

"19.07.23:Turn based game, more generous gacha than the other games by the same company. As of 1.2 it's still very new so of course not a lot of content is still out but as much of the story as we've seen... it's pretty interesting. Edit as of 02.2025: Powercreep is insane, storyline a yapfest with no skip button (!!), rng everywhere. I have given up on it, pity.",1,2025-03-02 19:08:53

"Was good. Story's inconsistent and drag. Belobog was the best, after that it's all yap-fest. Dialogues are boring as hell. Like when you are forced to extend your essay to meet the minimum word count. Certain Characters' stories overlapping the main story Overuse of element implant. Lacking shielder options. Power creep is the worst here. Old characters are useless. Lacking almost any other character options for other contents. As expected of a gacha game.",1,2025-03-02 13:39:54

"Seriously it's time to add a Skip button for those long and tedious dialogues, not everyone has the patience to sit through them for hours. Other than that as a new player i have a lot of problems with some of the content difficulty: it's either too easy at times or too difficult ( mostly bc i don't have those OP five-star characters, summoning currency is too scarce and rates are abysmal)",2,2025-03-02 13:10:09

"After playing HSR since day 1 the game is going to the point of intense powercreep. HP inflation in endgame content, new mobs catered to new characters only making old characters obsolete, lore getting boring and new characters potential are locked in their duplicate and BiS weapon making it necessary to get them. Overall the game has a lot of flaws but its still enjoyable but as a warning don't try to invest too much because the game is about to take the road of powercreep similar with HI3.",1,2025-03-02 10:29:40

"Took a break for a while and after coming back all of my limited characters were completely worthless: the power creep is really bad in this game. I tried pulling the newer 'meta' characters, but the amount of time to build new characters is super long and extremely frustrating. The story quality has also significantly reduced, most of the dialogue is pointless and feels more like it's dragging out without meaning. This game does not respect your time or your investment.

"Combat is simple but fun with flashy animations. Most of the challenge comes from having the right characters and having them built properly. There's a good auto mode but powercreep is a major issue. Story is subpar. The first major planet is solid but it goes downhill fast from there. No skip button and slow text speed waste your time. It also suffers from poor English localization with grammar errors, text constantly getting cut off, and inconsistent pronoun usage.",1,2025-03-01 23:28:44

If you miss an event, you can still do it later and get the rewards! The story is even more interesting than Genshin. Because HSR release faster and more content compared to Genshin. They always implement new quality of life changes for players like every patch. Once you play this game, you have no reason to quit honestly.",5,2025-03-01 21:53:04
"One star for all the good memories from the early patches and another because I really love the rouge-like modes. For months now the story been either absolutely stupid or unbearably boring, filled with endless corridors where you have to do the same of two rage-inducing puzzles over and over again, while listening to the same of two points repeating in dialogue over and over and over.

Gameplay is going down the toilet, no thought is being put into the longevity the characters you obtain, so your team feels useless almost right after you put it together.

I am giving it a 1 star. And just because of its tiring gacha system. And constantly losing pity. I tried to pull on LC banner and lost to 25% and at 46 pity. Can't you put it as guaranteed LC?

You promised no more powercreep and to buff old units. What did we get after that? Castorice beta V1? You must be kidding everyone. I have already uninstalled all of the games on every single platform. And I'm not installing any of these ever again.

"Everything is fine, it would have been a 5-star rating, but there's just one problem, the ""STORAGE"". The storage of HSR is too large, even if you delete past quests, it's still big.

"I love the game especially the combat system. I hate it at first because I was like press buttons randomly like I did with Genshin Impact but as I kept on playing, everything seems to be going well and building characters is just so easy and the combat system which is automated, I just love it. Story is great 8/10, character design - great 9/10. Overall, the game itself is great. Idc what other player says, this is just my own opinion. Been playing since release. Keep up the good work Hoyoverse.",5,2025-02-26 17:00:07
"Well, looks like I have to lower the rating a bit since my last review... The game does have issues that are becoming more and more visible with every new patch, mostly powercreep issues, either in characters or lightcones. While it is true HSR gives more currency to players, the players are expected to pull for both characters and weapons to be able to comfortably clear the latest end game modes. We lack f2p options and actually viable 4 stars (I can count the useable 4 stars on one hand).",4,2025-02-26 16:41:10

"The fundamental of this game is inehrently flawed, there are no room for skill expression, the way to beat the game is getting better unit + good relics. Nihility is already gimped with EHR requirement while Harmony can just buff their allies right away with no such thing. Focusing on a single character is just waste of time because they will get powercrept few months later, and new char will use a new relic and planar set so you can't transfer your previous relic.

No one is happy about this, so I suggest either removing the character or removing the part where she can revive characters even though she's not in the team. This just makes the game extremely unfair, and you will lose players.",1,2025-02-26 07:11:01

"Better than genshin, less grind heavy and time consuming but its not open world, many units became useless without a e2 and they keep making powerful-er character so you have to keep pulling for new units. Going on the same money hungry road of genshin, the reward got WAY less generous since launch, the design got less creative and the color palettes are pretty repetitive. The story isn't very good. Also they keep making featured lightcones necessary for a good build which pisses me off.",1,2025-02-26 06:04:14

"Update: Game is getting stale. You have 3 end game modes other than grinding. Inherently, turn based games are low skilled and combining that with powercreep makes early characters practically useless. Every new char is always better than the old and can directly replace old chars in teams. The number of chars and access to these chars make it impossible to do any actual strategy. It is fun sometimes, but it's to the point I am thinking about quitting. Story is great, but I can watch yt for that",2,2025-02-26 05:26:10
"Don't download this game, the devs are way too greedy, they want to add characters that add account wide buffs, such as a teamwide revive for the upcoming anniversarry character. Waste of time and resources. The gameplay is fun at a base level, but it has been streamlined to doing everything on auto with no thought being put in at all. Examples of this, are firefly teams, where you literally turn off your brain & spam all your buttons for easy end game clear. The story is not worth the bother",1,2025-02-26 05:24:08

"I honestly enjoyed the game itself along with the characters' lore, arc quests, music, graphics, and boss fights in this game. Not many are fans of the game mechanics, which is worth giving a try since it is very easy to play as an FTP player. I do like the gacha system of this game since weapon banners have their own banners. It is also easy to grind for the characters/weapons of your choice. I would say the only con in this game is that you can't move down from world levels or do coop mode.",1,2025-02-23 01:34:51

Can't say I'm having the best time rn: There are far too many units that you need to clear newer content. At this point you need to get both new characters in a patch for every patch.

"I'm a 1.0 player and the game was good when it was in Penacony and it made me come back to play again. Ever since the Amphoreus update and some adjustments in the game, I slowly start to become uninterested since it's quite difficult to catch up as a F2P and casual player. From difficult end game contents/events, rewards not enough for F2P people, and lack of game content in general where it's just recycling. I get that this is a P2W game but it ruins the fun and has no thrill in my opinion.",2,2025-02-19 12:03:36
There's like 5-6 different reasons why this game is turning into a mess but I'll stick to the universal problems. I know it is a gacha but the way they are shilling new characters and phasing out the old ones is a big indicator of their predatory behaviour. New events give very few rewards compared to the beginning of the game. Endgame content suffers from artificial difficulty with enemies becoming bigger hp sponges with each patch. This is becoming a big casino from a turn-based rpg game.,1,2025-02-19 11:19:33

I refuse to spend months to farm 150+ pulls for a single character every damn time.

"One of my favorite games. The combat is great, grinding isn't bad because of the auto feature. The devs are addressing the old characters being weak compared to new ones. Also, there have been updates to change the recent 3.0 update by allowing the some of the story dialog to be ""skipped."" My only issues, my garbage phone. Solution: phone cooler. Allows me to run 60fps lowest graphics without crashing due to overheating. Also, a lack of 4 star units.",5,2025-02-14 14:44:04

I feel like this game kinda caters to everyone. If you don't like futuristic themes there's a planet that isn't as futuristic and if you like traditional themes then that's for you. There's also a wide range of fun and vibrant characters with fun interesting personalities and backstories. The story ngl is also really good but sometimes falls flat but don't let that make you delete the game because they definitely redeemed themselves on the lore in the newest update.

"Horrible, the story is terrible, there is no skip button, and sitting through the dialogues feels more like a chore than leisure free time activity as a game should be, I quit because of the horrible storytelling. It is a turn based game, but there is more talking than fighting, really dissapointed in how the game moved onwards.",1,2025-02-08 17:04:12

"Beautiful but fatally greedy, and now they have settled a lawsuit with the US government.

Patch 3.0 needs to be fixed sooner. Why are you waiting until 3.2 to fix how badly the story is presented? You have so many rewards gated by going through the story and you want us to wait months to fix something you should have had already months to prepare for. This is absolutely unacceptable.,1,2025-02-08 08:41:31

Story telling is both fun and modern-trend, not my cup of tea but it really works like magic. Some world is more beautiful than the other one, in both lore and aesthetics. The only problem I can noticeably see here is the older 5* characters kept getting benched by newer ones. Minus star for that.",4,2025-02-07 12:47:19

Guys WHAT is going on with your lazy animations and lazy storytelling? Why has the game declined when genshin and others are improving in their animations? Hours and hours of story with just a black screen and white text. You'd think the game doesn't make any money but that's absolutely not true. You need to put more effort in. Do your jobs. Basic animations and storytelling shouldn't be rare.,1,2025-02-07 05:48:25

"Great game, great characters and all but playing this game on a daily basis can become a chore and if you miss out, you can't pull the new and shiny characters without paying money. It sucks and the price of these so called packs are so damn costly. An avg person can't afford these types of games on a daily basis. Plus spending lots of money on a virtual character when you can spend that amount on a whole new AAA game is just insane. I can't recommend this game for new players.",3,2025-02-06 14:01:06

In the past, pulling once still had a chance of getting B5, but now it's impossible. I have to pull 70/90",1,2025-02-05 20:59:49

"The game is actually very fun to play from the stories and sidequests, but once you get into the endgame, its kind of hard to get comfortable in it since you most likely need some ""meta"" characters that would most likely be powercrept. And speaking of powercreep, it seems this game has a major issue with it due to them making endgame comfortable when you have max stat characters or the new premium characters because the endgame content mostly gives buffs to the characters being promoted.",4,2025-02-04 20:39:28

Ridiculous powercreep in the game. Most 1.0 characters are useless in endgame. A lot of the main story characters are not voiced. Events in the game are low effort. The game feels more like a chore than something enjoyable.,1,2025-02-03 11:04:36
Bro d system so good I can play this wen I m even 60 years old and you guys have to fix d bugs but nice game 5 star,5,2025-02-03 10:57:25
Frankly this game become trash game very quickly. You can't play end game content without pull new unit. Very absurd on power creep with ridiculous high hp inflation. Adding with very ridiculous and time consuming gacha relic system for make old 5 star unit or 4 star unit to usable in end game content.,1,2025-02-03 10:49:53

My only problem with this game is the relic and ornament grinding. It usually gives you 2 to 3 five star relic/ornament at the highest difficulty but most of it are useless ones because of its main stat and substat. I mean like why does it always give me bad ones? Not even a single one? The rewards are doubled and I grinding for like 12 times for the planar ornaments only to keep getting the same useless stats like break/def even though it's not suitable for the specific relic/ornament I want.,4,2025-01-28 05:00:44

One is the inherit power creep of new units, which come every update. Older units that were invested in, both in time and resources have now been useless in the games current version. Another large issue is the degradation of the story, it's characters and environments, specifically in 3.0. It's really unfortunate.",3,2025-01-26 13:15:36

"Everything from the colorism to the constant waifu pandering is just so ew. This applies to Genshin, too, and apparently ZZZ even sexualises their child-looking characters... Even if I might like Genshin, Star Rail, and Tears if Themis, I might just be done with HoYoverse as a whole.",1,2025-01-23 18:22:37
"The newest update is a dissapointment. The long awaited 3.0 update didn't come with any animation update, the storytelling is like a presentation with lack of cutscenes. i think the budget is now mainly going to zzz, seeing as there's no improvement on hsr story animation, and the 2d character trailers also drops in quality ever since firefly. zzz's trailers on the other hand are fluid not to mention what you said, their crazy good 3d animations. This also happens with genshin, after hsr.",1,2025-01-23 17:52:34
3.0 storytelling is so boring. Also sad that most limited characters released in 1.x are practically obsolete. If you're f2p and unlucky and always lose 50/50 you'll never beat endgame. With the bland storytelling is it even worth it to pay?,1,2025-01-23 16:19:37
"Terrible gacha experience, it will force you to pull a character just to keep up with the current patch while leaving the old character to dust away the powercrept on this game is so high that if you skip a character your account will enter hard mode. The character designs on this game is either recycled or recolored of the old ones. I thought this game was a turn base game, turns out it was a visual novel with no minimal animation on the story just text and blackscreens. What a waste of time.",1,2025-01-23 15:19:15

The missing english voicelines are getting to a point where it is inexcusable. Just accept the voice actors right to not use thier voice for AI.

Great combat and writing but the longer the game goes the more the end game content goes from skill based To pay2win which is just cringe, still the best out of the hoyo games but it's definitely starting to show the hoyoisms. 3.0 is just a ripoff of Lostbelt 5 from FGO plagiarism at its finest",2,2025-01-22 20:43:47

"Honestly, this opinion is completely biased, but i feel like i must share it. This is single handedly the worst hoyo game in turns of gacha. I've lost every 50/50 to the point where I don't have limited units that I should. If you want to play this game, then you have to be willing to rerolled accounts, because of how awful the gacha is to some accounts.",2,2025-01-22 09:43:11
"This game is peak? Honestly, not to upset the players, but it is SO MUCH better than genshin. It's easier, the stories are nicer, and the character designs are so complex and beautiful! Not to mention there are multiple heights. The pity might be a little trash sometimes but getting ur fav character is simple, only takes a few quests to get jades and a few reruns. And building teams are so easy. I absolutely love this game even though I didn't play it until a few months after it's release. :D",5,2025-01-22 09:07:23
"Feel like every time a new character comes in, the previous character before feels like it's going to be powercrept and let's not talk about the endgame content's HP inflation.

"Second hoyoverse game to play, expect some criticism. First off, the grind is STILL endless. The whole requirement of ""equilibrium levels"" is idiotic and probably just a method to force players to ""immerse"" themselves in a world when 9 times outta 10, they just rush over the story to continue the main story. The relics and light cones are just a headache. They follow the same system as virtually all Hoyo games, but still doesn't mean it's good.

"This game can provide a pretty cool perspective on turn based combat with interesting mechanics. But it a can, not a guaranteed. To experience the game to its fullest you need a lot of luck. Its a gacha game. There's Luck in getting the characters you want, luck in getting the weapons, and luck in building the characters.

Penacony was amazing. Don't let any bad reviews make it seem otherwise because the story and characters (My wife Firefly in particular) all have amazing back stories and really fun kits to use. I'd say now would be a great time to start playing HSR since it won't take long to catch up. Please pay attention to the story and don't just skip through it all.,5,2025-01-15 21:03:50

Characters designs & graphics are magnificent but the story keeps on deteriorating. With the latest updates it just seems that the story that is being released just revolves around the character that needs marketing rather than having the character be integrated into the story.

"As much as I like the story, and the new characters are cool, I hope you can fix the Aventurine bug soon because it ticks me off when I invest in my character that doesn't give me the right amount of shield that I need for the team.

"I love this game so much, the characters, the chill gameplay, etc. However, I couldn't rate it 5 stars, because I've played so many gacha games before, and I know that powercreep is normal, but they do it way too fast in HSR. Like I invest in a character and suddenly in 2-3 patches, they're kinda mid. Of course, I ike seeing my favorite characters do big damage too, and of course, powercreep is normal, but it's way too fast in HSR and I feel pressured to pull for characters that I don't like.",3,2025-01-15 08:17:57

"Aventurine is a top-tier sustain, yet he was bugged for an entire patch, and there's no compensation for it? The bug appeared right after his rerun banner, which felt like we got scammed. It‚Äôs unfair that this specific issue didn‚Äôt warrant separate compensation beyond the usual 300 Stellar Jades we get every month.

"Powercreep is becoming a bigger problem for every new patch. There are basically no characters you can get that are guaranteed to be viable long-term. The game's great and all, but if you want to clear endgame (and there's a lot of endgame to play here), you'll need to pull for a lot of limited characters, and they might not even be as effective as before.",1,2025-01-15 06:53:15

The longer the game is out the slower the story makes any meaningful progression (the last new planet was released 10 months ago in February) and the more obnoxiously difficult all end game content becomes unless you sink a fortune into the newest characters, even if your only slightly older characters are well built with solid teams. Some characters are practically useless unless you win their 50/50 gatcha 2 or 3 times.",1,2025-01-15 05:54:56

"I have been playing this game since launch and i have been enjoying it but my biggest problem about the game is how a lot of the events, game content and etc is gatekept until you beat certain story missions, which is fine. But there is no way to skip or even speed up the dialogue to get these story missions, which, without this it makes the game honestly not that fun.

After a decent start they turned the MC into a worthless cameraman. It is boring to play a story focused videogame as a character who does not participate in that story. Last 3 patches were especially egregious in that regard. I do not recommend playing this game anymore.,1,2025-01-13 06:16:33

And I have to go to a completely different area for it to stop, and when I go back it keeps doing it. Making the quests almost impossible to do. Please fix this? I'm on mobile",4,2025-01-10 23:30:47

Too much yapping and stationary storytelling. Id rather read a visual novel. And goodness that abysmal banana patch. Powercreep is too fast while the gameplay is just character and stat check. Not really enough strategy for a turned based game while the spd stat gated wth rng along with crit stats with the horrible relic system. Too many characters so little pulls per patch with a 50 50 and no guarantee lightcone banner which is just a picture with stats lol,1,2025-01-09 08:33:28

No, because she's annoying and won't let us make jokes as if hers were the best ones lol. Edit: I still dislike March 7, but ""The Hunt"" March is a good support/Sub dps, and her outfit is nice...

"The game is good, but it lacks one final touch to make it not only good, but outstanding. Is a skip button the reason? What is the purpose of lore archives if not everyone is ready to waste their time reading a long discourse full of boring nonsense? Then as a decoration?

Recently got back to playing the game and when I logged in to my old account all of my progress was gone. I double checked all of the servers( I play on Asia) and my game data seems to have been erased? I even double checked the email that I have signed into and it's the right email. Hopefully this will be fixed if I try to reinstall the app because I have dedicated a very generous portion of my time into this game.,1,2025-01-02 03:38:24
Light novel very boring to play through the story with no skip button. If you want to slog through hours of written text with product placements for characters go ahead Personally love the gameplay shame I don't get to do enough of it,1,2025-01-02 02:08:44

"The game is great. Awesome visuals and characters. The game play is easy enough to pick up. You do have to like/love RPGs and the grinding and farming it takes to level up your characters. But the bosses are so tough, and for the most part, you have to be lucky to beat those bosses. If you think it's a pay-to-play game. Yes, and no, you can still play and progress in the game. You just need a little bit of luck (mostly).",4,2025-01-02 01:13:41

didn't expect to like a turn based game this much. there's still strategy involved unless u whale then every content becomes braindead auto-able. not full 5 stars from me because some characters are just weak and unusable in the meta. and sometimes story in events are too long and draggy. but overall a fun game.,4,2024-12-31 16:17:53

"Like all surprise boxes/gatcha games, good stories, and good graphics, but in the end, all experience is broken because developers get greedy. Developers think that if someone pays real money and does not get the characters he pays to get, he will invest more money. Well, not, this means no payment ever again. There is nothing more disappointing and discouraging to play or pay than 5 star duplicates. 50% probability of promoted character is a pure scam.",1,2024-12-25 18:07:13

That's only true of course when voice acting is even there, as it has been missing more and more frequently with each patch. Do you have a favorite character?

A good gacha should support true f2p, not just f2p with occasional splurges, which is what most people end up getting baited into being with a system as stingy as this. It also has other classic abusive tactics like a relic system where no relic is ever truly perfect, encouraging permagrind. The story is amazing and the combat is great!

Enjoyed the game. Love the aesthetics. The gatcha rates are horrible but enjoyed the gameplay so i didnt mind to continue playing it to pass the time. Still hesitant to create an alt account because of the unskippable cutscenes. Major cutscenes are fine abd tolerable but the side quest cutscenes are just atrocious. Walls of text that have no bearing and are a waste of time. I wont be spending money on it until its more user friendly to create alt accounts. Pls add skip function to the story.,3,2024-12-18 04:51:23

This game is a masterpiece! Do you want to play boring endgame content every 6 weeks for 25 mins tops? Do you want to farm for a new character(that costs way too much) for years in a tedious and frustrating way every day only to have them be power crept after 4-5 months? Do you like playing 2-3 events tops in each update where you can't even use your characters? Do you enjoy boring and endless amount of dialogue in both main story and events without the option to skip? Then play this trash!,1,2024-12-17 22:53:56

"Incredible story, good character design (both with personality/backstory and design), good combat.

It's coming to a point where you need meta teams or the newest meta units to beat things like endgame content. If this keeps up, eventually those previously meta units will become obsolete, just like the ones before them, so you'll constantly need to pull for new units (which are 95% 5 Star units, so you can't even guarantee pulls really) to replace the old ones over and over and over.

"I've been playing this game since ver. 1.0 came out and personally, i love this game. The story is truly mesmerizing (Besides luofu imo it sucks)with every patch we get new story quest i feel even more satisfied with lore (coming from a person with lore obsession). The turn based combat is also good in my opinion, at least once you understand what's even going on. Ultimates or skill animations are also pretty. The exploration is not too hard, and rather chill and enjoyable for casual players.",5,2024-12-10 01:01:30

"The game is very fun and has mazing designs and music, however unlike other hoyoverse games I played , power creep is very noticeable here which as a result makes you think twice before actually rolling the gacha. Overall a good game but needs an answer to power creep even if it like fgo's strenghtening quests that permanently buff a characters kit every now and then. Story needs to avoid stuff like the killing npcs to show the antagonist is serious part that the 2.5 version story I hated it",3,2024-12-10 00:40:58

"Game is great despite its huge size due to being open world, which most turn based game doesn't have. For those who preferred hsr to be action-combat like genshin, I'm strongly against that (this game has its own uniqueness). Complaints: make the story skippable, as it slows down the gameplay, bc some ppl (like me) prefers fast-paced quest clearance. As for limited gacha, 90 pulls guaranteed 5* chars isn't f2p friendly (esp for endgame contents), not to mention light cones are included too.",4,2024-12-06 15:01:00

So far for a turn based game its rewarding and really good gameplay wise spenders will breeze though low spender or free to players will have a decent challenge. good story so far no complaints graphic wise it's definitely looking good but could be better on pc but it's very well optimized so far on mobile overall great will see how the updates go expecially balance wise for low spending and free to play players,5,2024-12-06 14:47:58

"Storyline is good, the character designs are *chef's kiss*(except for jade, screw her honestly), and the overall gameplay is nice. I'm not a big fan of exploring and stressing myself out with puzzles so the maps were so peaceful for me, and having Acheron in my team with her skill to kill enemies without entering battle is so niceü•π.

"Fun game that has a well written story and very interesting characters. Only thing preventing this from being 5-stars is how absurdly hard endgame content gets. Not everyone can afford to purchase the new characters, and I find it quite hard to easily clear endgame content with older characters, as I don't have a lot of the new characters. The game is still enjoyable, but if you want to make the most of it it's like you're incentivized to spend money and an absurd amount of time into it.",4,2024-12-04 08:30:27

Although the combat mechanism would seem a bit complicated at first you'll get used to it eventually. The animations is somewhat unique in the story mode, it may switch to 2D design with something animated. What I really like is the rewards and achievements, It can be F2P friendly if you're hardworking, And the permanent events!

"The game is fun, pretty characters, amazing graphics. I love the ultimate character animations, so beautiful! But I noticed 2 things. 1. There is a huge lack of male characters in a multi gender game. 2. The meta is extremely hard to keep up with and you constantly have to pull for new characters. If I use Blade right now and compare him to Acheron, Blade is unmatched compared to Acheron. The old characters are worthless now because of the meta and everything new being REALLY strong for no reaso",4,2024-12-04 05:21:49

"Thanks, Sunday HSR. I, 25 M, got a divorce with my wife, 24 M, because of you. I know it might seen silly, but you genuinely pushed the hinges off of our relationship. Everytime I see my wife, she's looking at you. Everytime I ask her, ""What's wrong?"" When she looks sad, she says; ""Nothing.. I just remembered about Sunday's backstory."" It's like she doesn't even bother with me anymore. The only time she talks to me nowadays is always about Sunday. Sunday. Sunday. Sunday. What's my beautiful w",5,2024-12-03 17:55:21

"I play HSR since its launch. Love the character designs and turn baaed gameplay, so far. Story wise it is okay and provide few cliffhangers to look forward. The major downfall however is the messy plots. I feel Hoyoverse try to squeeze in so many characters (which are irrelevant) to the story progression with tonzillion dialogues, making it super bloated and hard to follow. Isn't it time to introduce ""skip"" function with added plot summary to the story?",3,2024-12-03 09:16:36

"The game is solid. The story is like pizza when it's great, it's unbelievable, and when it's not, it's still pretty good. However, the biggest problem is progression. Farming takes a very long time (at least without spending money, I tend not to). Repetitive battles make the game feel dated. Additional options don't help if material can only be obtained by repetitive auto battles that you HAVE to watch. This broken element keeps me away from playing more of the game.",3,2024-12-01 11:58:03

"The game was good but it's kinda hard to proceed when no skip button, I usually just reread the story or watch it later after completing the chapter.

"Excellent story, excellent graphics, easy mechanics, excellent music, immersive, to the point that sometimes I feel the same things the main character does. I've been playing this game since it came out. It's a huge breath of fresh air from hoyo's other very popular game and actually relieves my burnout. Turn based is a funny joke, there are many things you can do to make it less turn based with some characters' abilities like stall enemies or give yourself extra turns.",5,2024-11-27 00:44:20

"The game is ok, But the powercreep is disgusting. I Saved stellar jades and even bought a few only for my units that i like to play to get powercreep. No sense of balance, Every enemy units hp scaling in every patch is disgusting. 4star units are now irrelevant. Good job mihoyo, Buying things here are not worth it.

loved the story although i hate turn based game... the plot and characters made me love this game!! the only thing that makes me bored in this game is constantly dying from enemies. i always die because the characters Ive always pulled are Nihility or Harmony path which makes me lack of defense and healing. overall its great!!! the only problem is enemies are too HARDDD TO DEFEAT!!! blablabla i wont complain anymore.,5,2024-11-25 20:53:17

"I do not know why people say this game is F2P while every character want their own signature Light Cone which is their 5* weapon basically, old characters get powercrept really fast by a huge margin, and many characters will either perform really bad without their dupes are kinda functions properly only after having some. Game has 50/50, events and story mode sometimes is hard to beat so you need new characters and end-game content is also new character performance exclusive.",1,2024-11-25 16:04:54
"It's a very fun game, it's not like Genshin but this game is probably almost better since it doesn't take 80 years to load and the NPCs don't attack you like Genshin, in this you can see the enemies so your alert, and this has auto fight, infinite stamina, cool techniques and the character designs are very cool including the characteristics and the backstories, although some people actually want some characters to have a happy backstory, but as a dan heng simp he is a ‚ôæÔ∏è/‚ôæÔ∏è, SO HANDSOMEE AGRHHHH",5,2024-11-25 15:46:41
"Pretty nice game though the combat gets boring rather quickly. I like the characters and the animations are sick, it's also nice that the gacha currency is easier obtainable than for Genshin. The names for some characters are lacking a bit though... ""Sunday"", ""Blade"" and ""Rappa"" (a rapper). At least the character designs aren't copy paste HI3 or GI.",4,2024-11-25 15:36:49

1. Endgame is becoming impossible. Doesn't matter if you whale or ftp. 2. Relics too randomized. Remove 5 layers of rng and put in a relic currency system. 3. Lack of variety. Expand beyond FUP and Break. Give love to DOT and add more types. 4. To many limited characters are being released. Allow old characters to rerun and more in one rerun. Also create more standard characters. 5. Screwllum is an npc. Actually knocking down a star just for that. 6. Not enough men. I like women but I like men,2,2024-11-22 00:23:02

"As a turn based RPG, I find that this game needs more planet exploration. Gacha wise rates are around 0.6% for a 5 star character and hard pulls/ guaranteed drops are 180 pulls. Time wise quests take a long time because you cannot skip dialogue which is a major drag in terms of time. Leveling is self explanatory and is meant to be over time.

There are still some things I have issues with. Main issues are storage (30gb too much), Gacha system (not the best rates). Overall a good game that I actually enjoyed (surprisingly) :)",4,2024-11-06 07:00:01

"One of my favourites games so far ! I kinda find the critics too harsh for a game that just got released... For these that complain about ""nothing to do, no content"" It's because you rushed it all already... I mean you can't expect in a month to have 1000 characters, 100 maps, and a ton of events and content. What's important is building your team and have your own progress, you have to be a minimum patient and it's a rpg game so I don't understand the ""linear"" complaint while there's far worse",5,2024-11-03 23:26:05

Really fun and great story,5,2024-11-03 20:09:03
pretty good. it's pretty clear what the developers want and how they achieve it. but although everyone says this. I also wish the wish system was better. it shouldnt undermine a p2w's advantages but f2p should be given a fair chance to have a bit more number of 5 star characters (not standard banner) than what is currently achievable. that too with significant grind. but a pretty polished and enjoyable game with unique mechanics.,4,2024-11-03 19:32:22
"With every new update, new characters are added, new stories, new areas, but alongside these, there should be bug fixes and optimization for low-end devices. Having a ""delete past quests"" as an option like genshin does proves super useful, decreasing the humongous amount of space this game takes. It's a really, REALLY, fun game but the amount of GB it takes really disheartens me to delete it :(",3,2024-11-03 16:56:33

"They're good at making us attached to many of the characters. Unfortunately, many of those characters get severely powercrept within 2-3 months. The main story is good. But if HSR was a TV show, the main arc would be like Titanic brought to TV, while the mini/filler arcs would be like Three Stooges or Charlie Chaplin. The fillers just feel incredibly out of place. Endgame modes seem clever but I can't be bothered to read through multiple pages of walls of text describing the special mechanics.",2,2024-11-03 13:00:26

Why are people 1 staring this game for personal problems like bro your phone witch is clearly not a device to play this game on not having enough space is NOT a reason to rate this absolute masterpiece 1 star.

The story is great, although I have an attention span of an ipad kid, the majority of the game is fun but when you come to mid game content or end game content you need to grind relics (essentially give additional stats to characters) but it becomes a hassle.

"Too many unskipped jiberrish dialogue, and no skip button",2,2024-10-27 15:16:34
"This game is very rewarding. However the reason I didn't give it 5 stars I because firstly the game mechanics can get VERY repetitive. As this is a turn based game and battles might be slow or boring if you play for too long. They do have an option to speed up your combat and auto fight, which makes this issue slightly more bearable. Second is the stories. They are very well written but extremely long winded. I find myself just spamming the options to carry on with the story. A skip button üôè",3,2024-10-27 13:36:48
"The gameplay and story are solid, but pulling for characters is insanely expensive and they have a 50% chance to not even be the banner hero.

"The narrative, excluding the Xianzhou Luofu, meets expectations. However, the recent addition of missions for the Xianzhou Luofu has not only diminished the overall quality, but the new mission for Penacony has significantly lowered the standard of what was previously considered exceptional. Furthermore, the new mission involving Rappa lacks interest. Regrettably, the game appears to be declining in quality storywise. The mechanics and graphics are good, but the new missions are not.",4,2024-10-26 07:33:57

"This has become my favorite gacha game, and I live that they keep adding qol updates. It goes a little fast some times with the release of new characters, and there is little to do once you finish the new story quests of each patch, but they come fast enough that it is manageable and they have added new game modes several times already, or updated older ones, so there's always hope for more improvements.",5,2024-10-23 03:51:14

Probably lost my motivation to play because of the busy-ness. And now I'm back on 2.4. Sure, I've missed a lot of characters but I don't really mind.

"graphics are great, story progression is ok, and i love the bgm. character designs are eh though. it's not very diverse, i get it's a chinese game but considering its global market i expected at least more diversity in terms of character ethnicity (especially skin colour) and clothing design (esp for the women since almost all the xz women have the same design motifs). often times as well it's hard to farm for relics and materials. as f2p it's manageable but a bit difficult, an ok game i guess",3,2024-10-22 02:11:17
"Honestly, best f2p game I have ever played. The story goes above and beyond for a mobile game, I'd say it's better then most triple AAA games out there currently. Penacony story is phenomenal, same with the graphics and character design. I have spent money on the game as well and feel like I got my moneys worth with how much enjoyment I've gotten out of the game.",5,2024-10-22 01:50:57

"Probably the best example of how a freemium game should be. Nothing is locked behind paywalls. All characters and content can be acquired freely, and gacha currency is plentiful to free players. Even events can be played after the fact, reducing FOMO. The gameplay is just right for a mobile platform, mixing standard turn based combat with immediate interruptions using character's ultimates. The final boss fights of each story arc are absolutely show-stopping in their delivery and execution.",5,2024-10-21 10:27:46

"Story and character-stories are amazing, but the turn-based gameplay is very tiring. I loved the simulated universe but even this became boring after a few weeks. Still worth 4 stars for the story, world building, character design (for Penacony characters specifically, most of the other character designs are boring at best and psychic damage at worst, as in they don't convey the job of the character nor their personality at all) and lore though.",4,2024-10-21 06:05:37

"Don't have too much gripe for the game, it is a really interesting plotline so far and good setting. However I rate 3 stars because of the graphics. I use higher end Android devices like Galaxy S and Pixel, but the game still renders at 540p even on max graphics settings. This ruins the immersion and frankly don't expect this in modern games. I think users should have the option to change actual render resolution. I don't even mind the performance hit, like I said should be an option (not defaul",3,2024-10-20 22:47:24
"Fun game overall, but once again, Hoyoverse has an utter lack of diversity when it comes to characters. How many patches later and Arlan is the only character who's skin isn't paper white. Not to mention how they make insensitive references to slavery in his kit. I will be going F2P in all Hoyoverse games until they finally listen and make the necessary changes to include proper representation and diversity in their games.",1,2024-10-20 22:41:21

Battle-focused events (limited and perm.) are hardly doable if you don't get your hands on the latest character releases. Stellar Jade is way too difficult to come by. Gameplay and exploration are slow, bland, and repetitive. Far too much time and effort is required to build characters. This game gets boring FAST.

The rewards too are very good and the characters are fast and easy to build. the Lore is a bit suprising from all the events and things that are happening but it's also pleasing and well-written. Most of the lore however are in dialogues and there's no skipping. So if you can't handle lore then don't play.,5,2024-10-12 23:13:02

"It's really a good game, but it takes a lot of data and space, and it makes my phone act up, I wish it was only Playstation like genshin because it holds more storage than my phone, I haven't played it in a while because it always Freezees other than that it's a really good game.",3,2024-10-10 22:14:32

"Started of great but became more of another hoyoverse greed because no matter how much you try to invest into the game the compensation you get is so little and the meta is moving at an insanely high speed that is almost impossible to catch up with atrocities unskippable cut scene that force you to play the game for hours. Trust me on this along with Genshins requires you to invest too much time in your life which is up to the point that it controls your life, which is not a good thing.",1,2024-10-10 20:28:09

"Fix these loading bugs when you can't enter the game, needing to relaunch 20 times for it to let me play. Also, not having an option to skip all these useless dialogues just shows how little devs care about players' time. I don't enjoy reading dialogues, and I skip them anyway, but wasting too much time doing so. Not to mention that there is a skip button, it appears when you need to replay some part of a quest.

"Well made but disappointing immersion. Story is paced awkwardly with Dan Heng's story being told in a split narrative as early as planet three plus the transition to Imbibitor Lunae's integration into the story being clumsy, and characters quests range from what I consider well made (Natasha) to ones where nothing happens. World building is good but has many unfortunate breaks (Seele's dress, QED.) Has a handful of deep side quests but ultimately still too messy to be good quality writing.",3,2024-10-08 22:02:21

It's only 3 Months old so it might grow into some good later but is a bad spin off of Epic 7 or summoner War currently. Great sound tracks and battle music, just like Genshin.

It's basically farming simulator, and it overshadows what the story, events and character interactions has to offer. I've been playing this for a year and it's frustrating.",2,2024-10-07 19:41:48

Not sure if these devs are just incompetent or what. But the way the balance and handle things is atrocious. Do they wonder why it has such a Mediocre rating? Depsite the what looks like a decently quality game without a ton of mtx which in a way hurts it in terms of whales anyways. But they balance especially bosses like garbage like they don't know what they're doing.

Literally the best game ever . They care about their players and ingame rewards properly aswell and even if you are busy you can play it .,5,2024-09-20 20:38:14
"And how this game literally great even more than genshin impact I hav no words to describe the it's story line,music,animetions,graphics all things are enough to feel you are in real anime world but if creators make this game an open world then it's too great but it's okay we just need fun and this game give me a lot of fun üòä",5,2024-09-20 18:47:08
"I have a new flagship phone with 16 GB of RAM, but the game won't start. It gets stuck on the loading screen with the train, and the loading bar doesn't move past that.

Powercreep: The Game. Top tier meta units arrive and die before they ever get to see a year.,2,2024-09-19 13:40:46
"I understand why the developers don't players to skip the story content they've spent so much time on but you simply CAN NOT force players to engage with a story they're simply not interested in. Skipping needs to be an option because mindlessly clicking through the slog of dialogue is grating. Otherwise a great example of a gacha game done right, all things considered.",4,2024-09-19 11:12:28
Since it is a turn based game so it's kinda boring. But the storyline is awesome,4,2024-09-19 10:46:43
nama ku budi,1,2024-09-19 09:17:56
"Too much power creep, except unlike other games that try to design unique and interesting abilities, star rail will make characters with the same kit, element and class that are just straight up better versions of old characters. Hard to get excited even for whales when new sss tier units directly make older characters obsolete since there's no balance patches either. The story is a complete snooze fest most of the times, the world ""exploration"" is a joke and the events suck even more.",1,2024-09-19 07:45:26
"5/5 story 5/5 animation 5/5 character designs 1/5 gacha odds, you're better off staying with the default 3 starter characters if you're trying to stay F2P and beefing them up as much as you can",3,2024-09-19 07:42:47
So cool and sometimes funny ü§£,5,2024-09-19 07:26:19
So it's a great game to be honest but I had something happen that got me really pissed. Like it logged me out 3 times and after I signed back in it restarted all my progress. Not cool.,3,2024-09-19 06:23:45

"I love this game. Compared to a lot of mobile games, this is full fledged. The world is very interactive. Characters are very well fledged out, the stories are AMAZING including the side stories. Sometimes I have to stop and absorb the story tbh. It's also not super grindy, which is amazing, tho I do actually enjoy a little grinding and putting my teams together optimally. :) keep up the good work!! Can't wait for the next installment, I just finished the wardance!!",5,2024-09-19 02:46:04

Bug:(Spoiler) Btw there's a small bug where when you beat the first major boss in Belebog it gives you both Preservation Trailblazer and Harmony Trailblazer despite you unlocking them way later.",5,2024-09-19 01:50:27
Its pretty fun,5,2024-09-18 21:27:09
"Honestly this game is pretty good. But the devs is so alergic to make Trailblazer hang out with or having them be in Dan Heng's storyline that it's ridiculous. No worries, I know that that main audience is male, I'm just disappointed that they marketed TB, March & DH as a trio but make TB hang out with March only most of the time",1,2024-09-18 20:28:12
"I love this game so much...the story, the characters, the gameplay, puzzles...sometimes I can't put the game down. I've played since day 1 and I don't plan on stopping.

"There are many mobile games that fall behind their PC counterparts and competition. This is not one of them. Exploration is easy, and being on mobile doesn't make it unnecessarily difficult. Each battle and puzzle you complete is up to you for how fast you want to go, while also putting up a great challenge. Not the mention the outstanding story, characters, and world building. It's extremely immersive and compelling. I play this game because I love every single thing about it.",5,2024-09-18 13:36:19

"I don't rate games much but as someone who loved stories whatever media it is, HSR is just IT for the mobile games. I loved the designs, even the machanics. The action may be low effort unlike Genshin but the stories are Top Tier. I love how they switched POV to make me see other character perspective. And Penacony is peak storytelling and I loved it so much. Keep it up HSR team!",5,2024-09-18 11:31:32
"I really like this, I just dislike the turn based battle, and the fact I can't jump or glide. The reason I gave it a 4 star was because when I was playing it refused to show the background, it was only black, and the only thing I saw was the characters, doors, and chests, which made it hard to navigate Edit: The issue with the BG seems to have been fixed, I'm not exactly sure but I'll play around a bit more before I give it a final review",4,2024-09-18 10:44:28

"It's a turn based game with rotations using summonable units. Not all are but the mass majority are. I personally enjoy the game, the visuals and characters the gameplay and repetitiveness are all well executed. I have played Genshin too and Zenless but by far the story the way you can freely progress and the quality of life access to materials and ease of use. Consist updates and the teams listen to us players and make changes not only necessary but for the better. All in all I would recommend.",4,2024-09-18 03:29:03

"it just gets boring cause its the same thing and it feels too meta, grindy ,and like pulling for characters is expensive or just hoarding your tickets if you dont plan to spend tons of money.And i dont like that you have to plan for characters you need NOT WANT CAUSE ENDGAME IS JUST HAVE THIS CHARACTER TO WIN and just forget about pulling copies if youre free to play cause it will ruined your experience in the future if you ran out of pulls and its just a very money hungry game",1,2024-09-18 00:48:57

0.6% gacha rate with extremely hard to get premium currency is way too shameless for a gacha game. No skip on story. Pity is so far and most of the time will lose 50/50 on pity. Gameplay is also repetitive and boring farming for extremely hard to roll good stats on relics. The game size is extremely large for a mobile game.,1,2024-09-17 15:03:37

"The best mobile, cross-platform game on the market. It's an RPG, so not for everyone. The graphics (especially on PS5 and PC), characters, story, additional content, and combat are all top notch. Team synergy is much more important than just wale-ing out on characters and light cones. Only a few gripes: make a skip dialog button, cancel ultimate button, and get rid of the 50/50 pull. If we're investing into pulls, make the pity a guaranteed. Losing the 50/50 makes me want to quit playing...",5,2024-09-15 08:01:55

"Overall great game, story, animation, song and all. But it gets harder with battles as a new player with no good char especially after equilibrium upgrade, keep dying, some char build resource only obtainable 3x per week, and relics..progress is slow, so you keep struggling with mobs. And character designs, most kinda repeats the same designs, sorry but its just so plain and bland it gets boring, feel like nothing new at all. And the eyes, can it get better?

Honkai star rail is actually one of my favorite games the art style is pretty the game has good graphics the world's are all super pretty the story is amazing but sometimes I hate how unlucky I can get in this game when it comes to trying to a character I have never won a 50/50 yet I still think that this game deserves 5 stars. There is a lot to do this is game farming can be annoying but the story line makes up for it. Farming for the strellar jades are actually somewhat easy.,5,2024-09-14 08:10:51

"The only thing I recommend is putting in a skip button for all the storyline, just in case it's a really, really long one(there are definitely some long parts). But it is interesting. Great character designs, I love the special move and ultimate animations. Definitely 5 stars for me. I like that it's an open-world game, and the way you run around and just find certain enemies. The game isn't easy but it definitely isn't hard either. I can actually lose in this game and not even be annoyed.",5,2024-09-14 00:41:08

"Decently fun, the story is nice! Blatantly, a cash grab, but that should be expected. Honkai has an mmorpg level story that's very well done. It's honestly one of the only reasons I still play. However, let's go over the negatives. Oftentimes, there is just so much clutter in side quests and character interactions that it can be overwhelming. The drop rates are abysmal 99% of the time. You can roll 80-100+ times and not get the banner hero. The rolls are astronomically expensive as well. 3/5.",2,2024-09-13 23:22:07
"The characters are awesome, and it does not require you to spam click like genshin or zzz. However, it is a bit hard to farm warp tickets if you are free to play, and you can't skip cutscenes. Other than that, it's really good and perfect for anime simps.",4,2024-09-13 22:08:35

Worse experience with this game.. I can play until version 1.3.0 only. Devs didn't maintain device compatability. I spend $$ before now can't even play.

The best rpg game I've played. Totally worth it One thing gone wrong. On the recent patch there was 3 rerun banner along with new character feixiao. There will be another reruns in the second phase which i didn‚Äôt like as an f2p player. As usual there should be two reruns and two new characters because many of us don‚Äôt get enough time to farm. Other than this issue I've really enjoyed playing. Keep up the good work hoyo!,5,2024-09-11 06:22:59

Game is really fun to play and build characters only problem is the devs constantly add updates and new features that require so much storage space and don't seem to bother to downsize any of the updates at all resulting in this game easily overtaking half if not most of your storage space making impossible to run the game smoothly. They should really focus on optimizing storage comsumption better or at least give us an option of what to download and what not to if we don't immediately have to.,2,2024-09-11 05:54:36

"I had really high hopes for this game, but I'm sorry to say I was disappointed. I absolutely LOVE the characters and lore and everything story based, but I can not get behind the game play. While it's visually appealing, all the ultimates take 7 years to play out and after using each one multiple times in a TURN BASED battle, it gets old quick.",5,2024-09-11 02:45:05
"It just costs too much for new characters, and they basically become a hard requirement as you progress because eventually you wont be strong enough even when using the free characters.

"One of the best games I have ever played. Everything is vibrantly alive, in art direction, story, and gameplay. While gameplay is swayed in prebuilt directions, the game allows you to do toolbox builds and even encourages it with the limited resources you normally find in a gacha. I doubt I will ever find another gacha to match. The only downside is the hard throttle on pulls due to the free to play nature of the game. It makes losing 50/50s due to only having soft pity *hurt*.",5,2024-09-11 01:11:07

"Recommended by my brother, I actually enjoyed the turn-based gameplay aspect of HSR. The storyline was a hit or miss sometimes, but I feeled Penacony is peak storytelling at its finest. Though the same cannot be said with the RNG grinding+farming of relics in the game. In fact, the hardest part players may or might not liked doing is finding the ideal main stats and substats in the style that you want your units' gears to be. It's worth the time and effort in the end once you complete your team.",5,2024-09-11 00:40:05

"The game until panacony was brilliant. The story, the characters , personalites. Everything was brilliantly done. After panacony however, the content seems to be rather "" filler "", messy/ unpolished and feels like there is no love behind the work. The latest characters are good , but the patch they come out in do not hold any standing against previous story chapters. Its as if hoyo ran out of ideas or time so mashed something together rather than something of substance. Shame",3,2024-09-10 23:45:24

very good game the only issue is that newer events require the newest trailblaze quest to be finished to evene have access to them. Till the time a new player or returning one is able to finish them they might be shifted to the perm events with lower rewards but can also not appear there and gone forever,5,2024-09-10 23:04:21
"If you're looking for a story-heavy game with lots of rewards and new game mechanics almost every patch to keep you interested and hooked? Well this game certainly takes the spot. The game and character design only adds to the flare, and not to mention the music. However, the only reason I gave 4 stars is because I would only like more representation in the game, as it would matter to the global community that the game is targeting.",4,2024-09-10 22:44:57
"This is probably my favourite Hoyo game. It doesn't have the same level of exploration like Genshin but there's still a surprising amount to discover & the stories/characters are excellent. The fighting is easy on a phone since its turn based and you can also hit auto and let it run through it for you which is soo nice for getting mats for levelling characters. Especially if you don't have so much time in your day, you can let it run while doing something else. Highly recommend this game üëçüèª",5,2024-09-10 22:41:27

"Unlike Mihoyo's other games, this is a genuinely great game underneath the monetization; to be precise, a great turn-based RPG with good writing and simple-yet-deep gameplay. Unfortunately, like them, it's still an always-online Gacha game that's absolutely ravenous for your time (and money). Getting every character and levelling them (and their equipment!) to lvl80 is painful. If you're going to play any Mihoyo game, play only this one.

After a whole year of playing I can say that the developers really care about my time as they keep adding more functions which would allow to live life at the same time! The story is engaging, I enjoy character designs and gameplay a lot. The best project by HoyoVerse so far!

"This game really is great, the visuals, story telling (95% of the time), vast amount of unique characters, beautiful locations, fun dialogue, and unique worlds. Even the combat is really fun, and the team behind it has done a good job at adding new elements to the fighting system, with only one issue. A lot of ways to play the game is completely locked behind having specific characters. At least from the standpoint of creating unique teams. Other than that, I definitely recommend everyone try it",4,2024-09-10 05:36:24

My experience was fine until I opened it the second time and now it won't load ms in the game. I closed it many times and opened it again or waited for a few minutes until it took me 25 minutes. I don't know if it's because of my storage space or what that's causing the problem but my storage still has a lot of space.,3,2024-09-06 05:31:41
"This game is very fun and offers days of story quests and character quests. The combat is in depth and there are many modes that offer challenging content. It has rougelike modes offering replayability and personally I enjoy the way characters interact both in gameplay and in story. The music is phenomenal, with extremely diverse tracks for bosses and exploration that make it easy to get lost in this awesome sci-fi universe. The story is an incredibly immersive experience.

No doubt the graphics are amazing, also various character designs, and skills are without doubt perfect, but this game is in desperate need of a skip button during the cut scenes and dialogues.

"I enjoy it very much, but some stories take too long to conclude. It's hard when you're hyped for gameplay but you get a sort of visual novel instead. I wish there's an option to speed things up. Maybe shorter scripts? Or integrate the dialogue in the gameplay instead of forcing the player to wait for the whole convo to end.",4,2024-08-29 17:12:06

"Honestly, it's a great game. I love almost all aspects of it: the soundtrack, the easter eggs, the character design, etc. However, when it comes to storage usage, it's too big for a semi-open world with turn-based combat compared to Genshin Impact, which has a huge open world. I hope we get a feature to delete past quests",2,2024-08-29 00:36:43

Similar to Genshin Impact but Its still very good, I like the story, quests, and events, and I like how they give us very good rewards and I really love the characters they're amazing, but I also need a option for removing past story quests to save storage just like Genshin Impact has. I would be very happy if they added it. Otherwise the whole game is Awesome!",5,2024-08-28 21:21:35

Now that people complained you have out of no where diffulty spikes that are only there to satisfy a player base that already quit and went to wuthering waves with new options to get things players have been asking for but only if you whale out. Game is in its final years before it loses its entire fan base.,1,2024-08-28 14:35:11

"Since there were no subtitles in my native language, I listened to the English voice actor and the Japanese voice in the game in order to understand the story with both of them, but I found so many difficult words that I did not understand the story. It takes hours to finish the story, and this time I thought watching cutscenes would make me understand part of the story, but when this game won the best story telling award (congratulations), I realized I didn't understand anything about the story",2,2024-08-28 09:45:58

"Lack of OP DPS men in the game as well as broken male harmony / erudition units makes me wanna quit.

"Editing my review from last time since patch 1.3, I absolutely love the game. The Penacony arc was definitely enjoyable!!

Firstly, this game is very ( F2P ).Secondly, this game have a good design character.Thirdly, this game also have a great storyline.Lastly, this game give you alot of reward for you to spent like an example steller jades for a limited banner character ( special tickets ) and a standard banner character ( normal tickets ).I Think This Game Is Very Recommended For Those People Who Don't Really Like To Spent So Much Money In This Game.",5,2024-08-26 10:16:08

"memorable characters, easy game and multiple end game contents with added mechanics and new niches, sometimes it's difficult to catch up due to some powercreep but that means to prioritise better and invest but regardless pull for whoever you like. story is sometimes really good but it can be too long and ongoing to make me skip spam most of the dialogue decently generous although sometimes i wish there were more free wishes for f2p but regardless you can get any limited character easily",5,2024-08-26 05:13:38
"I have played this game on my (Huawei Y9), I was able to open the game and play at low fps. but when I wanted to try it on my new phone (S23 ultra) it kept crashing as I was downloading.

I'm not even sure what the point of this game is because it takes so much time to load that I run out of free-time to play it. I've been playing for a week now and have barely gotten anywhere. Was playing a couple days ago and the game updated itself which restarted the app. I was stuck on the loading screen for an hour and only 37% through the game rss download before I gave up.

The story for the first couple of locations has been great so far, and I'm genuinely interested in seeing what happens next.

I lost my characters, my pulls and it made me upset, so I don't even play with the game that much anymore, because I lost most of my motivation to start from the beginning...

Very fun gameplay it's story is enjoyable and engaging with twists and plenty of side content the side stories and simulated universe is amazing.The only thing I want is a easier way to get a certain character not having to use the wish system witch doesn't guarantee you someone you really want. It gives u a pool of different characters to role from kinda annoying when your favorite character goes away for 9 months. Out of any of there games it's a 5 star def recommend playing game. ^_^,5,2024-08-23 05:48:42

"Easily my favorite mobile game of all time. Solid story, great characters, fun events, overall just great. I prefer the turn-based combat in Star Rail rather than the real-time combat of other games with this kind of style such as Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves, and there is an option to automate combat so it makes spending energy every day feel less like a chore. Even if I don't get around to playing, the energy overflow and the big events not going away make me feel like I don't miss out.",5,2024-08-21 12:01:28

"Probably the best Hoyoverse game even developed. The story is so captivating and I played genshin before even though the game story and adventure was good the main character was average as best but the hsr developer gave justice to the main character and every characters' development was really good. How the story was developed, a lot of praise to the sotry writer. I hoper they continue with this approach what they are taking right now so the quality of game doesn't go down.

Starlit homecoming kinda sucks now because you only get one instance of double rewards rather than daily reset which is arguably better especially because of relics and simulated universe. This sucked so bad to find out because I thought it would reset and it didn't the next even though it's a measly 4 instances.,3,2024-08-12 21:11:57

Good story fun game reminds me little of final fantasy. Has turn progression for combat. Love the travel aspect and finding disc for music. Wanna say after a certain lvl the game gets rather competitive you have to grind to certain lvls in order to progress in the storys.

"Honkai: Star Rail is one of the best games I have ever laid my hands on, but recently, it would glitch here and there, which is no problem. However, as I continued to enjoy the game and clear the apocalyptic shadow, it would just crash whenever I tried claiming my rewards, and it would also crash anytime I played more than and hour and a half, this problem is probably from how the game is optimized. Ultimately, hsr is an amazing game. All they have to do is fix some things here and there. üôÇ",3,2024-08-05 19:01:38

Amazing game! Love it but it's almost impossible each update to make space for it. Not mention lagging on my device when it comes to cutscenes. Or certain fights... As of right now I can't find a way to make enough space for the next update. So I will most likely be dropping it. Definitely would be better on PC if I had one.,3,2024-08-05 11:44:42
Its a really nice game if you have a good f Phine its very fun I never get board,5,2024-08-05 10:42:49
"I've played the game since released and honestly I'm no longer enjoy the game like I used one year ago. As a husbando enjoyer I can't help but notice just how different the treatment between male and female characters, like, male being easily replaceable unit and powercreeped by the girls. HSR is a good game, really, but if you're a husbando enjoyer like me, better think twice than swallow bitter pills.",1,2024-08-05 08:54:51
"HSR is a turn based RPG with an interesting sci-fi setting and fun characters. It's a free to play game with a gacha system for gaining new characters. There are many aspects of this game that are amazing, particularly the art direction, music, and writing. There are also some aspects that aren't that great like farming equipment for your characters and the fact that it's a gacha game. If you like turn based combat and are fine with gacha games, this is a must try.",5,2024-08-05 07:06:34

"I like the story, characters, art style, voice actors, music, and humor. I rarely (if ever) have performance issues. The combat is simple yet diverse; allowing for a multitude of beginner to try-hard strategies in the many end-game modes. Auto-battling boring material farming is a nice feature. The devs are generous with free pulls, and I never felt like I must pull a character to progress in the game since they usually have bonus mechanics that you can utilize to win a battle.",5,2024-08-04 23:47:45

Relic system is dogshit. It have so many layer of RNG. You can farm relics domain for 1 year & more but still couldnt get suitable main stat & correct 2 piece / 4 piece set for your characters. Relic that we get from farming / self modeling resin should at least have 2 good substat. Flat ATK & HP should only exist as main stat. Chance are there some useless substat get level up more than important one for your DPS or support. Devs should make filter tool to counter all this .,1,2024-07-31 18:39:20

I love most of the designs but it's quite repetitive and especially with the color schemes.",4,2024-07-31 05:19:29

One of the best turn based games I have ever played . The story is also excellent . It is also rewarding for both old and new players but there are times that events are lacking but regardless if that all the other aspect of the game is well polished .,5,2024-07-31 05:18:47
can't keep forcing myself to place this anymore. the grind for materials burns me out so fast. just the thought of loading up the game makes me tired.,1,2024-07-31 05:09:15
This game is amazing but i really really wish the powercreep was less significant. Characters released recently deal genuinely 10x more damage than characters from a year ago.,4,2024-07-31 05:03:40

"Fun but tedious. It is what it is though. I prefer the real time combat from Honkai Impact 3rd and Genshin Impact, hoping we get another Honkai game like that in the future. But for what it is, it's an interesting take and a fun one at that, despite being annoying with the ultra mega hard bosses and the competitive nerds almost ruining the fun lol.",4,2024-07-31 04:05:38
I very rarely finish mobile games but I completed the story. If you like anime/RPG's this is for you. The only downside would he the rate for grinding tickets but you don't need to spend money to win. Great graphics and many things to do.,5,2024-07-31 03:09:32

"Game is great. Like any other game, it's a gacha, but they do give a ton of free pulls and opportunities to get free pulls. The character designs are very cool, but unfortunately mihoyo doesn't believe in buffing or reworking older characters, so be prepared to have a lot of characters you don't use. Gameplay is great, story can get overwhelming or confusing, but overall pretty good. However, the stories are world by world so previous events tend to not effect the current story. 8/10",4,2024-07-30 22:15:24

"In terms of how fun the game is, it can certainly win the other games like Genshin or Zenless Zone Zero even if they are all different in terms of gameplay. Nowadays people want a game that doesn't take up too much time but can still attract their attention span so this is a really good game to start with. The developers have been constantly improving the game so it makes it a lot easier to finish up daily task or even difficult bosses. This game doesn't take up a lot of battery too.",5,2024-07-30 18:47:38

I love this game. It is a turn based game with a unique/well designed story taken place on a space train! The characters have unique styles and back stories even the 4 star ones. The best cones are easy to get in the game. You get an easy 5 star pull right from the geico. The enemy types are varied but gameplay will get repetitive if you are a F2P.

"A very charming game. Turn based combat, OST that fits the ambiance, fairly unique characters (Boothill my beloved), and a gacha system that isn't unlike any of Hoyoverse's other games, same pity, same rules. The story is intriguing, but knows not to take itself too seriously at times. The main trio are fun to follow around as you travel different planets, solve the big problem with the people of each planet, leave, rinse and repeat. Overall, an enjoyable experience.",4,2024-07-29 07:25:02

"I had play this game for a few months when it released , and I got bored of it after the release of sliver wolf. Most of the characters are not unique, is same the character models reuse just with a add on tail or horns ,and the gameplay is too boring there is only 2 options per character to use in any fight ,which is a bad design soon there will be a character with 3 options to choose and it will power creep the game.

Even Minecraft has like end credits,though afterward,you can do whatever. I'm not far,so my rating is high. It's fun so far. I hate the doomsday beast though. Hope it sufer",3,2024-07-28 10:53:44

"I want to love this game... The characters and story are very good, along with the cinematics and story, but the gacha system ruins the whole experience. The feeling of missing the 50/50 soft pity and having burnt all those resouces for nothing, ruins any enjoyment I got out of the rest of the game. Having spent actual money on it makes it even worse. So thank you HSR for helping me to stop playing.",2,2024-07-28 02:04:25
"Simply the best turn-based RPG gacha around, and imho Hoyoverse's best. The graphics and character design are gorgeous, gameplay is engaging with lots of different modes, story is solid and the world engaging. Just a fantastic game, really fun and perhaps most importantly, it respects my time as a gamer. In a market saturated with gachas, it has become so valuable to me when a game respects my time and rewards my efforts accordingly.",5,2024-07-28 01:54:11
"A perfect game. Best turn-based since FFVII I haven't been interested in turn-based games in a long time, especially since WoW. I tried this because I loved Genshin Impact and I wished to learn more of the story from their shared universe. I found that not only is it awsthecially beautiful, but the gameplay is exciting and interesting. But more importantly, there's solid endgame and the devs listen to you.

The bosses always get multiple turns per one of my characters turns and it's unfair because the boss does more damage than my characters, and they keep locking my characters so I can't use them. For example, freeze. If let's say my dan heng is frozen, his turn will be later, and even he doesn't attack, he only recovers. Then, the boss freezes him again so I have no chance to use him.",2,2024-07-24 02:49:18

Dialogues are too lengthy and trying so hard to sound deep, that it became hard to understand. (Mr. Sunday, please stop talking about the caged bird!) Also a lot of lengthy flashbacks to build character instead of incorporating it bit by bit to the current story. Weak writing.

hoyoverse constantly participates in cultural appropriation in their other games and has cast a self-admitted sexual abuser as the voice of an upcoming character (chris niosi as the voice of moze).

"Firstly, as every hoyo game, this one also has a wonderful aesthetic world to it. The characters are stunning and everything is well put together. There's many challenges, which can be hard, but still doable! There's a lot of things to do and every time new enemies drop characters rotate in the meta. I've never had any bugs or problems with the game and I haven't met any Toxic players. Perhaps it's maybe not very f2p friendly in the endgame, but still not a big problem.",5,2024-07-20 03:07:34

In honkai star rail there's only one darker character, in genshin all the characters based off of real cultures are heavily white washed and as far as I know there's no in ZZZ (although I haven't played so I might be mistaken). Worst one is in HI3rd, where a character literally bleached her skin cause it was ""too dark""!????!

ITS AMAZING. I think the game is great overall. It gives good rewards in game which allows you to easily get The 5 star characters you want and even they're lightcones.(They're weapons pretty much that increase they overall stats) I really enjoy the story mode. The music is great. They give you plenty to do early in the game and even later in there's always challenges you can do. I really enjoy the game keep up the good work,5,2024-07-17 02:29:00

I adore this game. However the lack of diversity regarding skin tones is very disappointing. Not to mention how the few characters who have darker skin are gray.

For Penacony to have taken inspiration from the Jazz age which was pioneered by black people you refuse to release any characters that aren't white.

Arlan, the mentioned character, also has MULTIPLE racist stereotypes that are present in his trace names.

"So far, I'm enjoying the experience, the graphics are like, good good (despite my settings set at the Lowest Graphics). Though one problem i always have is how long it takes to load on my device after pressing ""Press to Play"", which is at exactly 1 minute, 28 seconds and 17 milliseconds, that may not sound long, but it feels like HOURS when you're someone like me. I can understand if it's because of my budget phone but nonetheless, great game overall üëç",4,2024-07-10 17:38:53

"Basically gambling when it come sto obtaining characters. It's fine if you get lucky. Not so much if you don't. I've lost way too many 50/50s to see this game as worthwhile anymore. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if the standard banner characters were good, but the vast majority are garbage. I will take my money elsewhere. If I had to estimate, I've probably spent around $1k on this game. Just not worth it. Roughly $3k on Genshin but at least I get what I pay for there.",1,2024-07-10 04:15:51

"The developers of this game have clear bias towards female characters & their male players. I liked the game at the start because the story & combat seemed interesting, but the more the game progresses, the more it becomes another waifu game for men filled with strong female characters. It is disappointing to see how they just neglect most of their male characters & give them mediocre kits & little to no promo. This kind of unbalance leaves a bad impression to me as a female player.",1,2024-07-10 03:10:40

Extremely well thought out. Very fun!!!! The animation is absolutely extraordinary.If you love turn based combat this is the perfect game for you.You can F2P but I loved it enough to buy! Hope y‚Äôall love it as much as I do!Edit: after they added the new character Acheron I have been having an absolute blast forever!Another thing is that even 4 star characters are viable for endgame content.My favorite 4 star can keep up with the dps's. Would recommend to anyone with enough storage.,5,2024-07-10 01:50:25

Unfun to play the game where not getting the character for specific game mode or mechanic.Can clear but not fully getting all the reward. Always feel left behind and under performance for every event. Guess only streamers and huge spenders can perfectly clear to grab all the rewards.

Amazing game that really tells the story. But as a day 1 player f2p the meta changes hurts my soul. Can't clear the hardest content since it requires top characters. Seele was left in the dust not able to compete against newer Limited characters. I hope there will buffs for the characters,5,2024-07-06 11:45:34
My favorite game from Mihoyo. I've been playing literally every day since launch week and while I have spent money on this game the amount of in-game currency you get is pretty stellar ;) and despite not spending much I have a full roster of characters just from playing regularly. The combat is fun and the visuals are stunning. I look forward to every new story patch and event.,5,2024-07-06 11:34:59

"The story can be insanely yappy like Genshin without a skip button. At least not that I'm aware of at the time of writing this review. Luckily, the story is good by gacha standards. The designs are top notch as expected from a Hoyo game. All the QoL that was missing in Genshin Impact is given here. Worth your time if you wanted more end game from Genshin Impact, you like like turn based RPGs, you like anime aesthetics, you want to collect waifus & husbandos, or all the above.",4,2024-07-06 02:44:35

"The constant grind for materials to activate character traces, ascend units/light cones is not great, and the hunt for relics is beyond time-consuming, a fact that's further driven home by the stamina system. That said, the stories are a great time, environments are gorgeous, and the music is incredibly good (massive props on the Penacony update!).

"Story started strong in Jarilo-VI, got lost in Luofu, and then crashed and burned in Penacony. Gameplay HEAVILY incentivizes playing the flavor-of-the-patch meta. Unfortunately, building one character takes 5 amber eras, so by the time you've built the new team, the meta has moved on. Furthermore, perhaps because of player demographics, the game is turning into shameless bait for waifu simps. Player community also suffers from a perennial chip in the shoulder about Genshin.",1,2024-07-03 20:21:55

"If you enjoy playing male characters and having a competitive male character team, this game is not for you. The male characters are only good for DPS, and the few male support characters are immediately powercrept by female characters and dont play as well in endgame as said female characters.

It's a good game im not even gonna lie but the space this game take from my storage is horrendous.

This game is an absolute travesty compared to genshin. It's greedier considering most characters are just going to underperform and suck without their light cone. And some characters just straight up suck without 5 stars. It's most recent Penacony story is nothing but a giant waste of time that's all spectacle and no actual thought yet it drags on forever with the most contrived plot ever conceived.

Seems like it'd be a good game but it almost exploded my phone. If you have an older android I would not get this game. Firstly it requires a TON of space and is too much for my phone to run once it is downloaded. I played for maybe 15 minutes before my phone got so hot I was genuinely concerned it would catch fire. I put my phone in the freezer than immediately deleted this game I have not had that overheating issue before or since. My phone is only 4-5 years old and runs everything except this,2,2024-06-26 09:41:33
"It's a great game and it doesn't take to long to get a 5 star, but I have a problem where no matter how many times I restart or re download the game, the map doesn't render, I can only see chests, NPCs,and enemies, which makes it hard to move around the mapsince I keep running into walls.",3,2024-06-26 09:15:14

Missing QOL adjustments to be a great turn based game. Needs a skip button for dialogue. Most side quests are unbearably long winded. Summoning materials are abysmal to acquire being F2P and even if you did spend its outrageously expensive. Taking months to saveats for a limited character to just lose the 50/50 at pity is demoralizing to say the least. Game definitely doesn't reward your time. Story is ok some characters are more annoying than it should be for how much dialogue there is.,3,2024-06-25 17:39:46

"As the game updates, it somehow gets worse. Main quests're just...not clicking anymore. Penacony's unnecessarily long and the ending wasn't satisfying in any way. A lot of stuff to remember the story, too much information. How am i supposed to remember all of those? Plus, the relic rng. I think it is pretty obvious, it has the sh*ttiest system i've ever seen.Three flats with the repeating defense main stat??I need decent relics at least if i cannot get the characters i want. And lag got worse.",3,2024-06-25 15:57:33
"They should rename the game ""just running around"". Or longer ""just running around,solving lame puzzles,engaging in even lamer unskippable dialogues"". Farewell penacony reads like a 10th century novel and a dystopic social experiment not to puke outta boredom. Let us skip the torturous dialogues, I promise it will be the qol upgrade of the century and improve store rating.

"Played from day 1. Story wise, it's a blast. Sadly, even 1 year has passed, Devs keep nerfing male unit before release. Male chara are ""subpar"" all around. Their damage-maximised output have to be paired to (harmony) unit, which is a female chara too. So The game is heavily centered around Female units to be meta. I hope they can balance out the performance for each gender units. Man, We deserve what we pay. Look, how Male units are so few & nothing special compare to Female units. Sadge",2,2024-06-22 15:43:28

I have a story... Since the moment of their creation I have held distaste and sworn I would NEVER play a gacha game. And have maintained that path all these years. I got mistplay last week to make some money from gaming. Yesterday I only because I was making money off playing I said I would TRY H: S R. Minutes in and I'm feeling curiousity and intrigue to the mysterious events that are the intro. And just like that I'm enjoying the sights and sounds and characters.

The characters are all so different and distinctive, with amazing designs. I love the style, and cut scenes are so amazing with their animations. This is the first game I've played by Hoyoverse, and I'm not disappointed. The hype is justified by the amazing characters, story, and scenery. Never loved a game more.

Also, y'all's need to add more chibis, I need to keep going on my roll of the chibi collector of hoyoverse. Also, for both games, PLEASE ADD A BOY CHIBI, FOR CRYING. OUT. LOUDD...

Honestly the one of only issues is that jumping is not possible which is sad BUT the game gives very nice experience and story that is full of plot twists. Although at the start of the game the plot in Hertas space station and Belebog isn't the best and this places aren't really fun to explore (which is only my opinion). Still the story there here is good enough to give good experience and the game is worth a shot. Another issue is storage - a lot of people donnt have enough storage to play.,5,2024-06-21 04:03:25

"This is by far my favorite game rn. It breaks my heart that I had to uninstall because it's ridiculously massive! At the time my phone was full, it registered as 37gb, but after I uninstalled, I had 43gb free! Insane! I just recently got a Galaxy Tab, so hopefully, it can handle that. Seems to handle PGR just fine, so we'll see!",4,2024-06-20 15:00:36
The patch update for every version is getting annoying. It takes too much time unlike the update in genshin. Now its 13gb just to update the current version.. I'm very disappointed on how you guys handle this.,3,2024-06-20 14:27:10

"This game is taking up a whooping 30 gigs in my phone now, in comparison genshin which I've been playing for 3 years now with all it's new regions takes up only about 20 gb (after it was optimized a while back). Look I love this game, the story and combat are all so good but my god I just can't keep playing when it takes up that much storage. Can't you guys optimize it like you did with genshin? In genshin we have the option to delete past resources can't that be implemented here too?",1,2024-06-20 14:09:49

its nice until you get to endgame and realise you can't actually do any content unless you pull multiple copies of characters and/or their light cones. which takes money,3,2024-06-20 13:23:59
The game so far is amazing! And the story is so good! I just have one problem and it's the storage... It's too much for phone users and the last update was way too much like- it went from 21 gb to 30+gb??? I deleted everything and still can't finish the update. My opinion is to make phone users choose the quality they want to make the data less. Thank you for reading!,5,2024-06-20 13:13:54

The combat is turn-based which is not my favorite but the game made it look so cool! Although it will get repetitive after a while. The story is the strong part of this game in my opinion. Every planet looks so unique with different puzzles and chests. My biggest complain is about character balance which is not ok at all. Edit: it still has powercreep issue to this day.

This game absolutely sucks outside of it's story to get good characters you need crystals. Which you can get within the game easy right no. You can farm your whole day away to get enough pulls for a 5star just to lose your 50/50 it put you in a bad mood after all them hrs just for your hard work to be trash or you can take the money route which gives you only 25 to 28 spins for 50$ and for 100$ its 44 the prices are way to high for what where getting just to lose are 50/50.,1,2024-06-19 10:27:22

"I would just lovee to play more games by hoyoverse , I like the graphics very much and it doesn't lag that much although it depends on the device I am using , currently I am using my iPad so it doesn't lag as much in my phone , the only problem is sometimes the game crashed whenever I was lagging a little, although I have nothing much to complain because it's all amazing! From the characters to graphics and gameplay! , I have never been this addicted in playing games every morning lmao",5,2024-06-19 07:50:32

"If you remember the Muppet Show, say it with me: ""Trains in S-P-A-A-A-C-E!"" The art is gorgeous. The main combat is turn-based (great for people like me who don't do well w/ quadruple bucky button mashers. There are different play modes beside combat. Lots of depth to the content, including associated media. Yes, it's a gacha. No whaling required, although I do support w/ monthly supply pass.

"Im not really into gacha games, and especially here the prices are extortionate, but you can pretty much ignore them and just play F2P. And honestly, it is a genuinely good game with cool characters and (mostly) great writing. Full disclosure, I did eventually put some money into the ""Express pass"" about 60 quid total after a full year of playing pretty much every day, and Ive paid that much for far worse games that did not entertain me for as long, so Id say they've more than earned it.",5,2024-06-19 06:08:38

"Decent game overall. Beautiful character and map design. Good story and music. However, progression resources are very limited for me starting at level 50+, and as a turn based game, there isn't too much to do. However though, the story makes up the lack of gameplay. I can't describe how I much I love the story, the characters, the art, the music.

"It's a very great game. Great sound design, graphics, animations, well designed character etc. I am giving 4 stars because I want a option called ""skip"".

"Why is it so hard to even get and collect 4 star light cone and character? The game treasures them as if they are limited 5 star. In addition, limited 5 star is difficult to get which I don't mind, but 4 star should be at least easily obtainable and max out as they are being handicapped, this game makes me feel like a handicapped person, the developer gives you a character that is being handicapped intentionally and ask you to pay so that you can enough chance to cure the handicapness.",1,2024-06-16 14:16:14

It's a really fun game with great characters and I still don't fully understand the story but I have fun just running around I don't have a PC or console so getting to play a game like this on my phone it's kinda hard to find the tools you need to level up and increase your characters and companions power so defeating major big bad bosses takes forever cause you gotta constantly retreat and revive your characters plus constantly changing the people on my team besides that the games fun to play,4,2024-06-16 11:26:13

"Largely, it's a great game, but the energy system could use an overhaul. 6 minutes to recover one energy with a max of 240, then 18 minutes to recover a single point in the backup reserve. If it's going to take that long, it would make more sense to recover a few energy in the main pool every six minutes and 5-10 energy per 18 minutes in the reserve. Makes it rather difficult and slow to farm Trace materials and relics.",4,2024-06-16 04:54:12

"The fameplay is lots of fun, but I had very few opportunities to summon new characters. I got 40 pulls at the very beginning, then almost nothing. As far as I can tell, there are only about 4 pulls available per month. Most of which will end up being useless light cones (artifacts). Uninstalled.",2,2024-06-12 18:00:04

This game wouldn't have survived if it wasn't a hoyo game. There's no justifiable means for the power creep this game has like pvp. The devs need to take a note from the other turned based games and give ways to bring characters up to the power level to be usable in new content that isn't making a new meta. Topaz and Ratio was brought back because of 2 new characters running back to back that catered to them. There is also a lack of 4 stars making it less desirable to pull from having them maxed,3,2024-06-12 11:34:14

"A breath of fresh air among the rising open-world genres of gacha games! While most of the time I usually get bored of turn-based gameplay, Star rail did not have that problem! Moreover, it did a great job in character design and personality! No kidding I'm invested to each one lol. But, its highlight has got to be its story! At first it started out pretty decent throughout the Luofu Arc, but when Penacony arrived it reached PEAK LEVELS of pacing, originality, and story! Looking forward to it!",5,2024-06-11 15:49:34

Game is really fun until you start fighting enemies that can divide or call for reinforcements and for some reason the developers let the game balance can go out the window for example in the Space Station you will fight these Hercules beetles battle starts off 4:3 by the time they get done calling for reinforcements and dividing it's more like four verses 8 which really becomes annoying,1,2024-06-08 02:49:42

"one of the best games i've played. well-designed characters, really good writing most of the time, decent combat system too. unlike that other mihoyo game, there is actually some things that are fun to do even after you max out on levels. overall, it's great, and i would recommend playing hsr unless you are a massive hater of the turn-based combat, or if you are afraid of wasting all your life savings on characters (which you really don't even need to do).",5,2024-06-03 16:05:15

"Mihoyo continues to impress. A fantastic game that boasts exceptional quality across the board, and has become a trend-setter to influence all new and future turn-based (and other) games. The game mainly suffers from horrible cutscene lag that doesn't have an easy (or in my case, any) fix, and increasingly rampant power-creep with each new character - with each new character being as strong or stronger than the last, the new content becomes more challenging (for better and for worse). 9.5/10",5,2024-06-02 17:37:03

"This is a very beautiful and detailed game, the graphics are awesome there is alot to the story of the game, every world that you go into is pretty cool but there are some things i dont like about this game that maybe you guys can change in the future, i dont like how the main character that is supposed to be you is so plain looking and there is no way to change her hair or clothes, i prefer running around the game as one of my other characters rather then the holder of the stellaron..",4,2024-06-02 15:50:16

"This game is amazing,but like any hoyoverse game on an OPPO 16S, it is unplayable and laggy but i have seen many gameplays of this game and i cant blame the devs for my choice of device and it deserves a 5 star or 4 star at the least. I can't play anymore because the texture glitches and dissapears, the whole experience is laggy after the new updates and the game was way more normal in the pre-register version. Sadly,the lag makes me unable to play the game but i can watch videos of the storyig",5,2024-06-02 13:49:37

"Ost, graphics, voice acting, story, lore, gameplay, character building, everything about this game is 5 star worthy. The gacha aspect might be worrisome to some, but you can easily finish the main story quests with the free characters the game provides you with, not to mention the game is F2P friendly anyways, saving up for characters is easy since the game is quite generous with rewards and events, and the quality of life this game has is superb, there is an auto battle feature for farming!",5,2024-06-02 11:46:03

I love this game but you guys really had to copy genshin impact like i love the game but overall im pretty impatient i just downloded it today but i do not like waiting though but i hope its worth it but please fix the game so i only have to wait a few hours to play becouse genshin impact took forever i downloded it back a year ago and it made me wait until 11:30 so i hope you make the wait shorter,3,2024-05-30 07:33:19

"This is one of my favorite games to play. I find the character designs and personality amazing. I love the combat style too even if I know it's not for everyone. The story is interesting and quick enough that I don't get bored of the story. It is a grind heavy game if you want to maximize the DMG output your characters can have. I have fun building my characters and maximizing their DMG...I somehow turned my Aventurine into a DPS because of this. It's a very f2p game, go for characters you like.",5,2024-05-30 01:18:26
"Boring gameplay. Things get little interesting with Aventurine but soon die down. The falling bs with 2 siblings is cringe af cuz it reassembles HI3. Almost every ending has this (Hi3). This game makes me think it's a spin-off of HI. As soon as Acheron said she was Raiden Mei, I deleted the game. Just, I get you want to attract HI kanchou but pls, I have enough. Instead of making it interesting, u only show ur lack of creativity. Utterly disappointed as dayone kanchou/trailblazer",2,2024-05-30 01:11:26

"It is a good game, but my gacha luck is horrible in it. Every 5* took me 70+ pulls. When I lost the 50-50 for Fu Xuan at 75 pity, it was the final straw. I had originally started playing because it gave more pulls then Genshin every patch, but I don't see any difference with its abysmal drop rates. There are also times when it crashes before starting. As this all coincided with WuWa launch and I got some good pulls there, HSR is the one to go.",3,2024-05-29 22:29:39

"It's really great. Very generous free 10 wishes per new banner. Really easy to farm for Jades. Aventurine boss fight is all RNG so just hope you have good luck and I recommend bringing AOE characters so you have a higher chance of living in the boss fight, But the 2nd Phase you can only use those who went above the specified number so really bring AOE characters. Overall great game, I don't recommend doing Trailblaze 65 Ascension quest it will make you story bosses harder. Tho my ARTIFACT LUCK‚¨áÔ∏è",5,2024-05-29 08:26:53

"the game itself is great. art style, characters, music, references, lore and much more. the reason why i rated 4 star is because there's a problem with the log in loading that turns into black screen for 2-3 minutes (or more) and just background music playing. i hope this gets fixed because i find it irritating. -thanks",3,2024-05-28 23:56:04

"A fun experience over all! The story line is amazing, the visuals and music are splendid and the characters are dynamic. It all comes together beautifully! My only qualms are that with every update the game is becoming a problem for my phone's storage, and unfortunately most cutscenes lag and buffer a lot which hinders the audio-visual and emotional aspect of said scene. [This has been a problem since launch on android devices] Hopefully this problem gets resolved in the next patch or so.",5,2024-05-28 23:14:47

The story and the characters are amazing. Even the gacha and quest systems feel more polished and more rewarding than other games. I had just one problem: Some of the battles are really difficult and it sometimes feels like the game locks new progress behind meta characters which you have to pull for. Which was not a problem when the game was released but now it is because more and more characters are being added. The game needs a world level lowering mechanic!!!,4,2024-05-27 06:15:34

A fun game that turns into a bit of a grind at the end. It's got an exceptional story that keeps getting better and has me hooked in from the word go. The gatcha side of things is fun although stressful as you might miss characters but everything else is a 10/10 with lots to do and a great emphasis on solo game play,5,2024-05-26 11:06:30

"VERY grind heavy game. It gets 2 stars because of the good story, fun characters, and cool worlds, but 99% of your play time is just fighting the same enemies over and over again for materials/currency. The power creep is also significant, which means it's a never-ending race to grind enough to level up the newest characters to be able to clear anything. If you play for story, characters, lore, or exploration, that gets annoying real fast. But if you play to fight, you'll enjoy it.",2,2024-05-26 07:59:22
"I love this game. Great graphics, characters and story. The only thing I have a issue with is the amount of storage this game takes up. I have 128 GB of storage on my phone, yet I'm still worried about how much space HSR takes up. Every update the amount of storage needed increases, and I really want to keep on playing. If it gets to a point where I need to start deleting things to play, I might just delete Honkai. I'm sure there's some way to lower or delete unneeded storage.",2,2024-05-26 07:21:18

"CS ignored my feedback so I'll make it public. Drop rates have become ridiculously low for me in this game both in the gacha and in farming materials. 50/50 is more like 20/80; You spend day after day farming for ""relics"" which often have random chances of rolling good stats. I've spent the last two months and have maybe only 1 relic out of thousands that has nice stats, when each character needs 6... Just about done trying with this game.

"Turn-based combat is widely regarded as a genre that emphasizes strategic gameplay. However, HSR's combat system appears to be limited to basic attacks, skills, and ultimate abilities. Furthermore, the strategic depth of the game seems to be heavily reliant on character abilities, which are obtained through gacha mechanics.

"This game FORCES you to like a certain character, to the point where it becomes absolutely insufferable. Being forced to go on a date with her wasn't enough for the devs so the game also forced HUGE parts of the story to be done with THIS ONE character on screen for the vast majority of the time on the new quests. Whoever made this game has an absolutely insane obsession with her and wants to shove it down everybodys throats as well. I'll have to unfortunately uninstall.",1,2024-05-23 06:55:40
"Oh, so good. I love how this game is very f2p and the pity system actually offers a higher chance to get the limited 5* we want.

It's a pretty good game and a lot of fun but there are too many updates. Almost every week there are new characters and it's really confusing. Also it takes a LOT of storage and sometimes there are missions that are almost impossible to complete.,2,2024-05-23 02:49:30
"I like the combat. Typical anime style. There's actually an 18 gig download after the 'tutorial'. Plus, there are stupid little things like short load times between every line of dialogue. Also, the characters talk about stupid things, so have fun being forced to sit through a lot of that. This kind of game design is why mobile games are still a joke.",2,2024-05-23 02:47:13

Really love that this doesn't fall into the pitfall that many gacha games do where it's too much of a chore to be f2p and to level characters. It's a good balance that actually keeps the game enjoyable. The music and the storytelling especially in the latest chapter are fantastic; I'm excited to see what comes next!",5,2024-05-22 23:16:47

"Its a great game don't get me wrong like the graphics stunning, the game play is amazing, the story is fantastic but my only issue is the storage and the battery drain like many other hoyoverse games it takes so much storage and I can't play that many other games that I would love to play like genshin impact or Honkai impact but I can't really have more than one of these games at a time because of the amount of storage they take up.

"I love this game, but Hoyo is disappointing me over and over again with the waifu favoritism. They always purposely buff the female characters either directly or indirectly with relic sets tailored specifically for their female characters. While the male characters are always with kits that have a mechanic that requires support. And guess what, most of the supports/buffers are female characters. It has been a year, but no limited 5 star male harmony character AT ALL. Very disappointed.",1,2024-05-22 10:33:37

"Much better than Genshin Impact because it respects the players' time more. You can auto battle any fight if you're feeling lazy, except certain storyline or boss fights. Farming leveling materials is very easy and quick. Farming gear is still the downside of things, BUT you don't have to worry too much about getting the perfect gear IF you keep your world level low. For casual players I would recommend only going to world 3 or 4, after that you do need to be picky about your gear, teams.",4,2024-05-22 09:16:00

I like it it's just that it's too slow to load and like it takes forever even if you have enough space for the game to download and every time I keep downloading the resources it keeps making me do it again and again and again no matter what I do so if this could be fixed that would be great and I really wish that when it loads it speeds up not slow these could be fixed this would be amazing thank you.,2,2024-05-22 08:24:28

Retyping a whole new review. Honkai: Star Rail is still a very fun and unique game that I enjoy playing very much. The graphics and art to the game is very appealing to the eye. Especially the lore within it. But it's been a good while now and I still have the same problem form the start where I can't hear any audio from the game unless it's an event from the main story quest.

Far more interesting story than I was expecting, a player avatar that's actually very powerful at end game, free units that are actually usable, plenty of things to do that don't rely on the energy/stamina system (when you run out), amazing OST, etc. Biggest con?

I LOVE this game. The game play is smooth on my phone and weakness matching my team for enemies is easy. Character summoning is much more accessible tha in genshin impact.

"Crazy how so many people think endgame content is locked to the ""new characters"". Obviously if you're F2P don't expect to get every single character (unless you're Aventurine and win every 50/50), but plan your pulls and learn to save your jades. This game is VERY F2P friendly, and is amazing for allowing you to beat content with the power of ‚ú®Ô∏èteam comps‚ú®Ô∏è.

New boss is too hard. Needs to be nerfed badly. You really have to get a good group shielder to beat it and you're forced to use the very weak and useless Harmony Trailblazer in the Penacony story boss in place of the far better free group shielder Preservation Trailblazer.

The lore's a blend of mystery, yet the dialogues are quite witty. Grinding's a bit of a stretch, but nevertheless bearable. Character designs and assets are beyond creativity. And Penacony's been a wild ride; it absolutely takes the spotlight away from Jarilo and Xianzhou Arc.",4,2024-05-11 16:40:34

The gameplay is good but what fuels my anger is the 98% dialogues and 2% battles in every story quests. Can we just get an option to skip long dialogue cutscenes? It's too tiring to keep on just tapping your screen (when on phone)/pressing the spacebar(on pc) Some of it are okay but it's just annoying when it takes too much,1,2024-05-08 23:53:15

"Game is great. When i first installed, i played it day and night. But after you finish the main story, side stories, character stories, mini games, theres nothing to do except grinding mats. Simulated universes are fun for a while, but after a couple weeks, it gets boring. You have to wait for updates for 2 months. And the game takes up over 20Gb on your phone.

"I adore this game so much. The graphics, the characters, the storyline. Everything. Expect 2 things. 1) Character ascension. It's tedious. It's annoying. It's boring. And then you have to level up your characters immediately afterward. Otherwise, you did all of that for nothing. 2) The Xianzhou Luofu storyline. It lacks entertainment compared to Belobog and Penacony. It's still good, don't get me wrong. But it is by far the most boring. I hope to God that we don't revisit it in the future.",5,2024-05-08 21:14:52

The characters each have their own back story, both those you can play and those that are NPCs. No necessary in app purchases!

"Relatively nice game, however if you're not 100% up to META you fall off behind on the story. The story bosses are way to difficult for a first time fight, you also get thrown into the bosses mostly blind and they appear unexpected. For example Aventurine, this boss is way too hard for players who don't really understand or immerse themselves in the META. Don't make the bosses this hard in the story.",2,2024-05-08 16:57:21

This game is so fun, farming is very easy since u don't need to do anything most of the time (autoplay exists), actually only time u need to manually play is when ur doing some mission which forces u to do so or in the endgame content. Very stress free game that u can just farm while ur class or while working too. Story is definitely top 10 for me (Luofu took it down a lot). It's very F2P.",5,2024-05-08 15:40:49

Phenomenal game. Too much content if anything. Keep it casual and you'll have fun. Great story writing aside from the XianZhou.,5,2024-05-08 14:38:25
Great Turn Based RPG Game!,5,2024-05-08 14:34:57

"Its alright, i hate that each new patch features challenges that would be easiest if you had the newest characters.",3,2024-05-08 14:21:41
"The graphics, the art, the animation, the storyline everything is so good. It's so engaging and also feeds us with greater characters with every update. Love this one!",5,2024-05-08 14:20:17

"It's no doubt the best honkai game we'll in their perspective genre.. well nonetheless their subsidies on pulling character is no doubt will be as great as their predecessor Honkai Impact, Truly Recommended and must try",5,2024-05-08 14:03:00

"The game is awesome and I love everything in it. The only reason I gave 1 star is that when I'm not connected to my house netwrok it always gives error code 1001_3, I have tried every solution but it doesn't work, but once I connect to my home's wifi it works fine, please fix this so I can give 5 stars, thank you",5,2024-05-08 13:34:01
Gameplay is good and the story is good but Averytime cutseen show up is always lagging,3,2024-05-08 13:32:57
"The game is very good, the animations are well made so are the characters designs and the events rewards are also good! Overall I really love the game but I only have one problem which is the storage it takes, it takes 25gb or even more and my phone can't handle it and we barely in 2.2",5,2024-05-08 13:31:18
I love the game and I wanna continue playing it by it's such a heavy game 24 GB my phone is 64 GBS and I don't have the space for it unfortunately,2,2024-05-08 13:23:28
Star Rail is such an unserious game that pokes fun at itself. The jokes write themselves and uses the most famous memes. The music tracks used are (chef's kiss). What cemented my decision to continue playing is when Wildfire played mid battle. We are going to be trailblazing for years to come.,5,2024-05-08 13:22:34
I love this game so much. thank you for helping me through tough times. thank you.,5,2024-05-08 13:18:51

"I've never loved a game this much before. As someone who's really interested in astrology related stuff, the overall theme of the game really intrigued me. Like what do you mean we get to travel from planets to planets. It's like any other gacha game but I'm a bit biased towards it only due to space-y stuff üêß",5,2024-05-08 12:55:37
BS lore that you can't skip and take up to TEN minutes with cartoon graphics and terrible voice acting... Another cheap Chinese game,2,2024-05-08 12:51:00

This game very good,5,2024-05-08 12:34:14
"Loving this! As a Hoyo player since GGZ, I enjoy this. Seing Honkai Impact characters again and few of Genshin's VA's. For the performance, it's good. It runs smoothly on my 4gb ram device. Character design and the animations are on top. However, for the story, it's fine and good BUT I didn't expect them to bring up deaths in here. It's ""Honkai"": Star Rail for a REASON.",5,2024-05-08 12:32:49

Amazing game!,5,2024-05-08 12:06:36
"Great game, story keeps me going and gacha is in my blood. I've been playing since launch and never faced any problems or bugs (running on snapdragon 870) everyone complaining are either facing skill issues or don't know wat gacha means. Regarding power creep well duh every game will do that not only this one and the game is very generous we can get around 100 pulls a patch so pulling characters ain't that hard",5,2024-05-08 12:03:17
Nothing else to say. But I love the story and the lore about characters and stuffüëç,5,2024-05-08 12:01:42

"Honkai: Star Rail is my day-to-day game to play, it's also my favourite game Hoyoverse has made so far! I love Genshin and Honkai too, of course. I don't really have any problems regarding the game, and I'm exquisitely satisfied with the rewards too!! Happy 1st Anniversary Honkai: Star Rail!!",5,2024-05-08 11:30:07

"The one to beat. Hoyoverse quality, a team that cares, generous rewards, excellent characters, a phenomenal story. This is the gold standard of gacha gaming, and good luck trying to dethrone it.",5,2024-05-08 10:58:52
"Previously 1-star because of error message. Has been played since last year and so far I have good experience. The plot and the character designs are interesting. Easy material farming because it has auto function. The developer is generous too always gives free 10-pull every patch. As F2P, it's enough. My problems are sometimes there is mistranslation for EN that's different from other language. Also please let us clear previous missions to reduce storage usage.",5,2024-05-08 10:58:13
This game is super generous i reccomend it,5,2024-05-08 10:55:47

I really like the gameplay it's not at all clunky and boring,5,2024-05-08 10:49:36
